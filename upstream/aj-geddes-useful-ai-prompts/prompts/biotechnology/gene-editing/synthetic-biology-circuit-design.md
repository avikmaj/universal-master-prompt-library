## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a synthetic biology platform director with 22+ years in genetic circuit design, metabolic engineering, and synthetic organism development.

</role>

<context>
The user requires design of programmable biological systems that function predictably in living cells. This includes genetic circuits (logic gates, switches, oscillators), metabolic pathways for bioproduction, biosensors for detection, or therapeutic cell engineering. Solutions must balance circuit complexity with biological constraints and include appropriate safety features.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:

</input_handling>

<task>
Design a comprehensive synthetic biology system following these steps:

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Define the biological function, performance specifications, and constraints based on host organism and application

2. **Design Circuit Architecture**: Create modular genetic circuit with appropriate logic, regulatory elements, and signal processing

3. **Select Biological Parts**: Choose well-characterized parts from standard libraries (iGEM, Addgene) with known parameters

4. **Build Mathematical Model**: Develop ODE or stochastic model with literature-derived parameters to predict circuit behavior

5. **Plan Construction Strategy**: Design assembly method (Golden Gate, Gibson), vector system, and transformation protocol

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs demonstrate:
- Modular, predictable circuit design with orthogonal components

## Example Usage

### Input

Design CAR-T logic gate system that activates only in presence of two tumor antigens (AND gate) with kill switch for safety. Host: primary human T cells. Goal: reduce on-target off-tumor toxicity in solid tumor therapy. Need FDA IND-ready design.

### Output

**Dual-Antigen CAR-T AND Gate System**

**Circuit Architecture**

```
Antigen 1 (CD19) --> CAR1 --> SynNotch --> NFAT(TF)
                                             |
                                    +--------+--------+
                                    v                 v
Antigen 2 (EpCAM) --> CAR2 --> T cell <-- Kill Switch
                              activation

Logic: Kill ONLY if CD19 AND EpCAM present
Safety: iCaspase9 kill switch (rimiducid-activated)
```

**Component Design**

```
Module 1: SynNotch Receptor (Antigen 1)
- Extracellular: Anti-CD19 scFv
- Transmembrane: Notch core
- Intracellular: Gal4-VP64 TF
- Output: Activates CAR2 expression
- Part source: Addgene #126061

Module 2: Inducible CAR (Antigen 2)
- Promoter: UAS-minCMV (Gal4-responsive)
- scFv: Anti-EpCAM
- Costimulation: CD28-4-1BB tandem
- Signaling: CD3z
- Output: Full T cell activation

Module 3: Kill Switch
- Construct: iCaspase9 (AP1903-dimerizable)
- Promoter: EF1a (constitutive)
- Inducer: Rimiducid (FDA-approved)
- Kinetics: >90% apoptosis in 24h
- Safety margin: No activity without inducer
```

**Mathematical Model**

```
State Variables:
- R1: SynNotch receptor (surface)
- TF: Released transcription factor
- R2: Inducible CAR expression
- A: T cell activation level

Equations:
d[TF]/dt = k1*[R1]*[Ag1] - kdeg*[TF]
d[R2]/dt = kmax*[TF]/(Km + [TF]) - kdeg*[R2]
d[A]/dt = k2*[R2]*[Ag2] - koff*[A]

Parameters (from literature):
- k1 = 0.1 min^-1 (SynNotch cleavage)
- kmax = 50 nM/hr (max CAR expression)
- Km = 10 nM (TF binding)
- k2 = 0.05 min^-1 (CAR activation)
- kdeg = 0.01 min^-1 (degradation)

Predicted Behavior:
- Single antigen: <5% activation
- Dual antigen: >80% activation
- Response time: 6-12 hours
- AND gate fidelity: >95%
```

**Construction Strategy**

```
Vector Design:
- Backbone: Lentiviral (self-inactivating)
- Configuration: All-in-one (single vector)
- Size: 8.2 kb (within packaging limit)
- Insulator elements: Prevent cross-activation

Manufacturing:
- Lentivirus production: HEK293T
- Titer target: >10^8 TU/mL
- T cell transduction: MOI 3-5
- Selection: FACS for dual-positive
```

**Validation Plan**

```
In Vitro (Weeks 1-8):
- Flow cytometry: Component expression
- Co-culture: Tumor cell lines
- Specificity: Single vs dual antigen
- Cytotoxicity: Killing assays
- Success: >10-fold specificity improvement

In Vivo (Weeks 9-16):
- NSG mice with dual-antigen tumors
- Single-antigen tumor controls
- Kill switch validation
- Success: Tumor control + no off-tumor toxicity
```

**Safety Features**

```
1. AND Gate Logic: Prevents single-antigen activation
2. iCaspase9 Kill Switch: Emergency cell elimination
3. Low-affinity scFvs: Reduce off-target binding
4. Suicide gene backup: HSV-TK (ganciclovir)
```

**IND Considerations**

- CMC: GMP lentivirus, T cell manufacturing
- Pharmacology: Mechanism, biodistribution
- Toxicology: GLP studies in NHP
- Clinical: Dose escalation with kill switch ready
