## Example Usage

### Input

We are developing an AI-powered cardiac arrhythmia detection system for a wearable ECG device. The device captures continuous ECG data, and the AI analyzes for atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, alerting both the user and their physician. Target users include patients with suspected arrhythmias and cardiologists for clinical review. Our clinical goal is to improve arrhythmia detection sensitivity over traditional monitoring approaches. We plan a 510(k) submission using KardiaMobile as a predicate device.

### Output

**Medical Device AI Strategy: Wearable Arrhythmia Detection**

**Device Classification and Intended Use:**

- FDA Classification: Class II medical device
- Product Code: DQK (Electrocardiograph software for over-the-counter use)
- Intended Use: Detection and notification of atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias from continuous single-lead ECG monitoring in adult patients (18+)
- Users: Patients for self-monitoring, healthcare providers for clinical interpretation and treatment decisions

**AI/ML Architecture:**

```
Signal Flow:
Wearable ECG Sensor -> Signal Processing -> AI Detection Engine -> Alert/Report System
    (Continuous)        (Noise Filtering)     (CNN + Rule Engine)   (User + Provider)

Algorithm Components:
1. Signal Quality Classifier: CNN for artifact detection and signal validity
2. Rhythm Classification: ResNet-based deep learning for arrhythmia detection
3. Clinical Rules Engine: Threshold-based safety checks and consistency validation
4. Confidence Scoring: Calibrated probability with uncertainty quantification

Performance Specifications:
- Atrial Fibrillation: Sensitivity >98%, Specificity >95%
- Other Arrhythmias: Sensitivity >90%, Specificity >92%
- Signal Quality Assessment: Accuracy >95%
```

**Software Development Lifecycle (IEC 62304):**

Safety Classification: Class B - Software contributes to hazardous situations but failure would not directly cause unacceptable patient harm without additional failure.

Development Process:

- Requirements specification with complete hazard analysis traceability
- Architecture design incorporating fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- Unit testing with minimum 90% code coverage on safety-critical modules
- Integration testing per documented test protocols
- System validation against clinical performance requirements
- Full traceability matrix: requirements to design to code to test

**Risk Management Framework (ISO 14971):**

Key Hazard Categories and Mitigations:

- False Negatives (missed arrhythmias): Mitigated through sensitivity validation, clinical labeling of limitations, recommendation for physician follow-up
- False Positives (unnecessary alerts): Mitigated through specificity requirements, confidence thresholds, clinical verification pathway
- Algorithm Failure: Mitigated through signal quality checks, fallback to raw ECG display, error state notifications
- Cybersecurity: Mitigated through end-to-end encryption, secure firmware updates, authentication requirements

Risk Control Measures:

- Confidence thresholds required before alerting (configurable by clinical setting)
- Healthcare provider verification required before treatment decisions
- Clear device limitations in labeling and user instructions
- Continuous algorithm performance monitoring with automated alerts

**Clinical Validation Plan:**

_Retrospective Validation:_

- Dataset: 50,000 annotated ECG recordings from multiple sources
- Reference Standard: Cardiologist consensus annotation (3 independent readers)
- Analysis: Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV stratified by arrhythmia type, patient demographics, and recording quality

_Prospective Clinical Study:_

- Design: 500-patient multicenter observational study
- Comparator: 24-48 hour Holter monitoring with physician interpretation
- Primary Endpoint: Sensitivity and specificity for AFib detection
- Secondary Endpoints: Detection of other arrhythmias, time to clinically actionable detection

**Regulatory Submission Strategy (510(k)):**

Predicate Device: AliveCor KardiaMobile (K163850) - smartphone-based ECG with AFib detection capability. Substantial equivalence based on similar intended use with enhanced continuous monitoring and expanded arrhythmia detection.

Submission Package:

- Device description and technological characteristics comparison
- Software documentation (Moderate Level of Concern)
- Clinical performance data with substantial equivalence argument
- Cybersecurity documentation per FDA premarket guidance
