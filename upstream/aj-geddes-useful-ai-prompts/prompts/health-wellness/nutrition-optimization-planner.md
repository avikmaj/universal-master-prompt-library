## Example Usage

### Input

Goals: Lose 15-20 pounds, have more energy, eat healthier overall. Current: Skip breakfast, large lunches (often fast food), big dinners, lots of snacking at night. Work from home, tend to eat out of boredom. Moderate cooking skills, can meal prep 2 hours on Sunday. No dietary restrictions. Previous diets failed because too restrictive.

### Output

**Nutrition Optimization Plan**

**Approach Philosophy:**
Based on your previous diet failures from restriction, this plan focuses on addition and optimization rather than elimination. No foods are off-limits - we're building better patterns, not creating forbidden food lists.

**Daily Nutrition Framework:**

_Meal Timing Restructure:_

- Breakfast: Simple protein + fiber (prevents afternoon crash)
- Lunch: Balanced meal (not compensating for skipped breakfast)
- Dinner: Moderate portions (you're not famished from skipping meals)
- Planned evening snack: Addresses nighttime eating proactively

_Core Principles:_

- Protein at every meal (satiety, energy stability)
- Vegetables as volume (filling without excess calories)
- Planned treats (removes restriction-binge cycle)

**Meal Templates:**

_Breakfast Options (5-10 minutes):_

- Greek yogurt + berries + handful of nuts
- Eggs (any style) + vegetables + toast
- Protein smoothie (protein powder, fruit, spinach, milk)

_Lunch (Make-Ahead or Quick):_

- Salad bowl: Greens + protein + grain + vegetables + dressing
- Buddha bowl: Rice/quinoa + protein + roasted vegetables
- Soup + sandwich or wrap (lean protein focus)

_Dinner (Fresh Cooking):_

- Protein (palm-sized) + vegetables (half plate) + starch (fist-sized)
- One-pan meals: Sheet pan protein and vegetables
- Stir-fry with rice or noodles (vegetable-heavy)

_Evening Snack (Planned, 150-200 calories):_

- Popcorn + small chocolate
- Fruit + cheese
- Yogurt + granola

**Sunday Prep System (2 hours):**

_Prep Order:_

1. Start grains cooking (rice, quinoa)
2. Roast sheet pan of vegetables
3. Cook protein (chicken, ground turkey, fish)
4. Wash and prep salad ingredients
5. Portion snacks into grab-and-go containers

_Yields:_

- 4-5 lunch containers assembled
- Cooked protein for quick dinners
- Prepped vegetables for easy additions
- Pre-portioned snacks

**Boredom Eating Strategy:**

_Pause and Check Protocol:_

- Before eating, ask: "Am I hungry or bored?"
- If bored: 10-minute alternative activity first
- If still want food after 10 minutes: Choose planned option
- Have low-calorie options available (vegetables, herbal tea)

_Work-from-Home Structure:_

- Designated eating location (not at desk)
- Scheduled meal and snack times
- Kitchen only for meal prep and eating

**Sustainable Progress:**

- Week 1-2: Add breakfast, prep lunches
- Week 3-4: Optimize dinner portions, plan evening snacks
- Month 2: Fine-tune based on energy and results
- Ongoing: 80/20 approach (nutritious 80%, flexible 20%)

**Expected Timeline:**

- 4 weeks: Better energy, reduced boredom eating
- 8 weeks: Noticeable changes, established habits
- 12+ weeks: Sustainable weight loss (1-2 lbs/week average)
