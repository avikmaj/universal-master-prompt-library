## Example Usage

### Input

We're evaluating a 150 MW CSP project in Morocco (Ouarzazate region) with 8-hour thermal storage. The project should provide dispatchable power for evening peak demand and participate in capacity markets. DNI is approximately 2,500 kWh/m2/year. Preference for solar tower technology.

### Output

**CSP Development Plan: Morocco 150 MW Solar Tower**

**Resource Assessment**

The Ouarzazate region provides excellent CSP conditions with DNI of 2,500 kWh/m2/year (6.85 kWh/m2/day average), meeting the viability threshold with significant margin. Key site factors:

- DNI quality: Top-tier global resource, consistent seasonal profile
- Land requirements: ~600 hectares for heliostat field and facilities
- Water access: Assess availability for wet/hybrid cooling (3-4 L/kWh for wet cooling)
- Grid proximity: Existing Noor Ouarzazate complex infrastructure

**Technology Configuration**

_Solar Tower Selection Rationale:_

- Higher operating temperatures (565C) vs. trough (390C) enabling superior thermal storage efficiency
- Direct molten salt heating eliminates heat exchanger losses
- Compact receiver design reduces thermal losses at scale
- Proven technology via Noor III and Crescent Dunes precedents

_System Architecture:_

- Heliostat field: ~7,500 heliostats (140 m2 each) with 1,050,000 m2 reflective area
- Receiver: External cylinder, 565C outlet temperature
- Heat transfer fluid: Binary nitrate salt (60% NaNO3, 40% KNO3)
- Power block: 150 MW steam turbine, 42% gross efficiency

**Thermal Storage Design**

_Sizing Analysis:_

- 8-hour storage at 150 MW = 1,200 MWht capacity
- Two-tank configuration: Hot tank (565C), cold tank (290C)
- Salt inventory: ~38,000 tonnes
- Storage efficiency: 95-97% round-trip thermal

_Dispatch Optimization:_
Storage duration enables evening peak coverage (6 PM - 2 AM) when Morocco demand peaks and solar PV unavailable. This maximizes capacity value and enables premium pricing.

**Performance Projections**

| Parameter         | Value       | Basis                           |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Gross capacity    | 150 MW      | Nameplate                       |
| Net capacity      | 140 MW      | Parasitic loads                 |
| Annual generation | 580-620 GWh | P50 estimate                    |
| Capacity factor   | 44-47%      | With 8-hr storage               |
| Solar-to-electric | 26-28%      | Annual average                  |
| Availability      | >95%        | Excluding scheduled maintenance |

_Uncertainty factors:_ DNI interannual variability (+-5%), equipment performance ramp-up (Year 1 at 90% of design).

**Grid Integration and Dispatch Strategy**

_Primary dispatch profile:_

- Daytime: Charge storage while generating 50-100 MW
- Evening peak (6-10 PM): Full 150 MW dispatch from storage
- Night shoulder (10 PM - 2 AM): Continued dispatch at 100-150 MW
- Overnight: Minimal generation, storage recovery

_Grid services portfolio:_

- Capacity payments: Firm evening capacity at premium rates
- Frequency regulation: +-10% ramping capability within 10 minutes
- Spinning reserve: Storage buffer enables rapid response
- Voltage support: Synchronous generator provides reactive power

**Economic Analysis**

_Capital costs (estimated):_

- Solar field: $180M
- Tower/receiver: $45M
- Thermal storage: $55M
- Power block: $60M
- BOP/interconnection: $40M
- Development/contingency: $45M
- **Total: ~$425M ($2,830/kW)**

_Revenue streams:_

- Energy sales: 600 GWh x $65/MWh = $39M/year
- Capacity payments: 140 MW x $50/kW-year = $7M/year
- Ancillary services: ~$2M/year
- **Total revenue: ~$48M/year**

_Project economics:_

- LCOE: $75-85/MWh (competitive for dispatchable renewable)
- Project IRR: 10-12% (equity) with 70% debt financing
- Payback: 12-15 years with 30-year operating life

**Risk Mitigation**

- DNI variability: Conservative P50/P90 modeling, revenue hedging
- Technology: Experienced EPC selection, performance guarantees
- Storage material: Proven salt chemistry, corrosion monitoring program
- Market: Long-term PPA anchoring majority of revenue
