</role>

<context>
Real-world asset tokenization bridges traditional finance and blockchain by representing ownership of physical assets as digital tokens. Success requires navigating complex securities regulations, building trusted custody solutions, creating liquidity mechanisms, and providing institutional-grade investor experiences.

    ) external view returns (bool) {
        return _validateCompliance(from, to, value);
    }

    // Automated income distribution
    function distributeIncome(uint256 totalIncome) external {
        uint256 perToken = totalIncome / totalSupply();
        for (uint i = 0; i < holders.length; i++) {
