## Example Usage

### Input

**Problem:** Portfolio optimization for 50 assets with risk-return constraints. **Current approach:** Mixed-integer programming taking 2 hours for full optimization. **Hardware:** IBM Quantum 27-qubit systems via Qiskit. **Timeline:** 3-month proof-of-concept for QAOA-based approach.

### Output

**Quantum Portfolio Optimization Development Plan**

**Problem Analysis**

Portfolio optimization with quadratic risk terms maps naturally to QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization), which is the native formulation for QAOA. The objective function:

```
minimize: -sum(r_i * w_i) + lambda * sum(C_ij * w_i * w_j)
subject to: sum(w_i) = 1, w_i in {0, 1}
```

_Quantum Advantage Assessment:_ QAOA shows promise for combinatorial optimization but proven quantum advantage on NISQ devices remains elusive. For 50 assets, classical solvers are highly efficient. Recommend focusing on proof-of-concept with scaled-down instances.

**Algorithm Selection: Modified QAOA**

Selecting QAOA with the following considerations:

- Native fit for QUBO problems
- Compatible with 27-qubit IBM hardware
- Well-studied error mitigation strategies
- Hybrid classical-quantum structure enables iterative refinement

**Quantum Encoding Strategy**

With 27 qubits, directly encoding 50 binary assets is not possible. Options:

_Option A: Reduced Asset Set_

- Select 20 most important assets (20 qubits)
- 7 qubits for auxiliary computation

_Option B: Discretized Weights_

- 10 assets with 2 qubits each (4 weight levels: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%)
- Remaining 7 qubits for constraint enforcement

Recommend Option B for more realistic portfolio representation.

**Circuit Architecture (p=3 QAOA layers)**

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.circuit import Parameter

class QuantumPortfolioOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, n_assets=10, n_layers=3):
        self.n_qubits = 2 * n_assets  # 2 qubits per asset
        self.n_layers = n_layers
        self.gammas = [Parameter(f'gamma_{i}') for i in range(n_layers)]
        self.betas = [Parameter(f'beta_{i}') for i in range(n_layers)]

    def build_qaoa_circuit(self, returns, covariance, risk_weight):
        qc = QuantumCircuit(self.n_qubits)

        # Initial superposition
        qc.h(range(self.n_qubits))

        for layer in range(self.n_layers):
            # Problem Hamiltonian (cost layer)
            self._apply_cost_layer(qc, returns, covariance,
                                   risk_weight, self.gammas[layer])
            # Mixer Hamiltonian
            self._apply_mixer_layer(qc, self.betas[layer])

        return qc

    def _apply_cost_layer(self, qc, returns, cov, risk, gamma):
        # Return terms: RZ rotations
        # Risk terms: RZZ interactions for covariance
        # Budget constraint: penalty term
        pass

    def _apply_mixer_layer(self, qc, beta):
        # Standard X-mixer for all qubits
        qc.rx(2 * beta, range(self.n_qubits))
```

**Optimization Strategy**

- _Optimizer:_ COBYLA (derivative-free, robust to noise)
- _Initialization:_ Start with small gamma, moderate beta
- _Iterations:_ 100-200 per layer depth
- _Measurement shots:_ 4096 per evaluation

```python
from qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import COBYLA

optimizer = COBYLA(maxiter=200, tol=0.001)
initial_params = np.concatenate([
    [0.01] * n_layers,  # gammas (start small)
    [0.5] * n_layers    # betas
])
```

**Hardware Deployment**

_Error Mitigation Stack:_

1. Measurement error mitigation (calibration matrix)
2. Zero-noise extrapolation (if gate count permits)
3. SPAM error correction

_Transpilation:_

- Map to IBM heavy-hex topology
- Minimize SWAP insertions
- Use native gate set (SX, RZ, CX)

**Performance Targets**

| Metric           | Target                         | Validation Method      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Solution quality | Within 5% of classical optimum | Compare against Gurobi |
| Circuit depth    | <100 after transpilation       | Qiskit transpiler      |
| Runtime          | <30 min per optimization       | End-to-end timing      |
| Success rate     | 70%+ trials find good solution | Statistical sampling   |

**Timeline**

- _Weeks 1-4:_ Classical simulation, circuit design, optimizer tuning
- _Weeks 5-8:_ Hardware execution on small instances (5-6 assets)
- _Weeks 9-12:_ Scale to 10 assets, benchmark vs classical, final report

**Success Criteria**

Proof-of-concept success requires:

1. Functional QAOA implementation on IBM hardware
2. Demonstrated optimization of 10-asset portfolio
3. Quantified comparison with classical solver
4. Identified path to scaling (or documented limitations)
