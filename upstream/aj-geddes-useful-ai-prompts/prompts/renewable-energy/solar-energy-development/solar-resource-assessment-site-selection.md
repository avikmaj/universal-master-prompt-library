## Example Usage

### Input

We're prospecting for utility-scale solar development opportunities in New Mexico. Looking to develop a 200+ MW portfolio over the next 3 years. Priority is identifying sites with strong resource, available transmission, and minimal environmental constraints. Need to prioritize 3-5 sites for detailed assessment and potential measurement campaigns.

### Output

**Solar Resource Assessment: New Mexico Portfolio Development**

**Regional Resource Overview**

New Mexico ranks among the top U.S. states for solar resource quality, with significant variation across regions:

_Irradiance characteristics (NSRDB/SolarGIS validated):_
| Region | GHI (kWh/m2/day) | DNI (kWh/m2/day) | Ranking |
|--------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Southeast (Lea, Eddy) | 5.8-6.2 | 6.5-7.2 | Excellent |
| Central (Valencia, Torrance) | 5.6-6.0 | 6.2-6.8 | Very Good |
| Southwest (Luna, Hidalgo) | 5.7-6.1 | 6.4-7.0 | Excellent |
| Northwest (San Juan) | 5.4-5.8 | 6.0-6.5 | Good |

_Climate considerations:_

- Interannual variability: +-5% typical for NM sites
- Seasonal pattern: Strong summer/winter differential (40%)

2. Land availability (>1,000 contiguous acres)
3. Transmission proximity (<10 miles to 115 kV+ substation)
4. Slope (<5% for optimal tracker deployment)
5. Environmental (exclude protected lands, critical habitat)
6. Land use (exclude irrigated agriculture, urban areas)

_Screening results:_

- Initial candidate areas: 850,000 acres meeting base criteria
- After environmental screening: 420,000 acres

**Recommendations**

1. **Immediate**: Execute land options on Site 1 (Lea County), install measurement station
2. **Q1**: Complete transmission screening for Sites 2-3, engage PNM/El Paso Electric
3. **Q2**: Environmental desktop studies for all priority sites
4. **Q3**: Preliminary energy yield reports based on 6-month measurement data
5. **12 months**: Bankable resource assessment for Site 1, development decision

The New Mexico portfolio offers excellent solar resource with diverse development opportunities. The Lea County site represents the strongest near-term opportunity with minimal constraints and excellent transmission access.
