## Overview

This prompt enables development of floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems that maximize solar generation on water bodies while supporting aquatic ecosystem health and water resource management. It combines marine engineering expertise with aquatic ecosystem management to create multi-use water infrastructure solutions for reservoirs, irrigation ponds, wastewater facilities, and coastal areas.

## When to Use

**Ideal scenarios:**

- Developing floating solar on reservoirs, lakes, or irrigation ponds
- Creating dual-benefit systems combining solar with evaporation reduction
- Designing FPV for wastewater treatment facilities
- Integrating solar with aquaculture operations
- Land-constrained regions with available water surface area

**Anti-patterns (when not to use):**

- Fast-flowing rivers or high wave environments
- Protected wetlands with strict ecosystem restrictions
- Recreational water bodies where solar would conflict with use
- Shallow water (<2m) with significant seasonal variation
- Sites with extreme ice formation

## Example Usage

### Input

We're developing a 20 MW floating solar project on a municipal drinking water reservoir in Arizona. The reservoir is 800 acres with stable water levels (2-3m seasonal variation), 15m average depth. Primary concerns are water quality protection, evaporation reduction, and maximizing generation. No recreational use.

### Output

**Floating Solar Development: Arizona Municipal Reservoir**

**Aquatic Site Assessment**

The 800-acre reservoir presents favorable conditions for floating solar deployment:

- Water depth: 15m average with 2-3m seasonal variation - excellent for anchoring stability
- Wave exposure: Inland reservoir with limited fetch - design for 0.5m significant wave height
- Water quality baseline: Drinking water quality standards, algae management is ongoing concern
- Coverage potential: 80-100 acres (10-12%) for 20 MW maintains ecosystem function
- Solar resource: Arizona provides excellent irradiance (5.5+ kWh/m2/day)

**Performance Benefits Analysis**

_Cooling effect advantage:_
Floating solar operates 8-12C cooler than land-based systems, providing 5-8% generation increase. For 20 MW system: additional 1.5-2.5 GWh annually.

_Evaporation reduction:_

- Covered area: 100 acres (40 hectares)
- Evaporation rate: ~2m/year in Arizona climate
- Water savings: ~80 million gallons annually
- Economic value: $50-100K/year at municipal water rates

**System Design Configuration**

_Floating platform selection:_

- Platform type: HDPE modular pontoon system (proven durability, UV stable)
- Module mounting: 10-15 degree tilt for drainage and production optimization
- Walkway integration: Maintenance access paths throughout array
- Coverage ratio: 80% module coverage, 20% walkways/gaps for water circulation

_Anchoring system:_

- Primary: Catenary mooring with concrete anchors on reservoir bottom
- Configuration: Perimeter anchoring with internal cable grid
- Accommodation: +-3m water level variation with slack management
- Materials: Marine-grade galvanized steel cables, HMPE synthetic ropes

_Electrical design:_

- String inverters mounted on floating platforms (marine-rated IP67)
- Underwater DC cabling to shoreline collection point
- Shoreline substation with step-up transformer

**Environmental Management Plan**

_Water quality protection:_

- Platform materials: Certified food-safe HDPE, no leaching compounds
- Maintenance protocols: Biodegradable cleaners only, spill containment systems
- Algae management: Shading reduces algae growth by 50-70%, supporting water treatment
- Temperature: Reduced surface warming improves water quality stratification

_Ecosystem considerations:_

- Coverage limitation: 12% of reservoir surface maintains aquatic ecosystem function
- Light penetration: Gaps and edges allow sufficient photosynthesis for aquatic plants
- Fish habitat: Platform structures may provide shade habitat for fish species
- Bird management: Design elements discourage waterfowl congregation on panels

_Monitoring program:_

- Continuous water quality sensors (temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH)

**Recommendation**

The floating solar project offers compelling value combining clean energy generation with significant water conservation benefits in Arizona's water-stressed environment. The 12% coverage maintains ecosystem function while evaporation reduction alone offsets 5%+ of project cost annually. Proceed with permitting while conducting detailed water quality baseline study.
