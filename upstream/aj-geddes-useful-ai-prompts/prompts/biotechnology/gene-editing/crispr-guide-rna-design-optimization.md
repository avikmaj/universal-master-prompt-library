## Overview

Provides comprehensive CRISPR guide RNA design and optimization for precision gene editing applications. Integrates computational design algorithms with machine learning prediction models targeting greater than 90% on-target efficiency and less than 1% off-target activity for clinical-grade applications.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Designing gRNAs for therapeutic applications requiring clinical-grade specificity
- Optimizing editing efficiency through systematic gRNA evaluation
- Planning comprehensive off-target validation for IND submissions
- Developing gRNA libraries for screening applications
- Comparing gRNA candidates across multiple design criteria

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

## Example Usage

### Input

Design gRNAs for PCSK9 knockout in human hepatocytes for cholesterol-lowering gene therapy. Need clinical-grade design with maximum specificity. Targeting exon 1 to ensure complete knockout. Will use SpCas9 delivered via LNP.

### Output

**PCSK9 gRNA Design: Clinical-Grade Knockout**

**Target Analysis**

- Gene: PCSK9 (NM_174936.4)
- Target region: Exon 1 (amino acids 1-152, signal peptide and prodomain)
- Rationale: Early truncation ensures complete loss of function, no residual activity
- Chromatin status: Open in hepatocytes per ENCODE liver ChIP-seq data
- SNP check: No common variants (MAF >1%) at target sites

**Top gRNA Candidates**

**Rank 1 (Recommended):**

```
Sequence:     5'-GAGCTGACCTTCGAGGTGCG-TGG-3'
Position:     chr1:55,505,648-55,505,667 (+ strand)
Efficiency:   0.89 (DeepCRISPR model)
Specificity:  0.94 (CFD aggregate score)
Off-targets:  0 in coding exons (<=3 mismatches)
GC content:   65% (optimal range)
Structure:    No problematic secondary structure
```

**Rank 2 (Backup):**

```
Sequence:     5'-CCTGCTGCTGGCCTTCGTGG-TGG-3'
Position:     chr1:55,505,712-55,505,731 (+ strand)
Efficiency:   0.82 (DeepCRISPR)
Specificity:  0.91 (CFD)
Off-targets:  0 in coding exons (<=3 mismatches)
GC content:   70% (acceptable)
```

**Rank 3 (Alternative):**

**Off-Target Analysis Summary**

| Analysis Tool      | gRNA1 | gRNA2 | gRNA3 |
| ------------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Cas-OFFinder (3MM) | 12    | 18    | 8     |
| CRISPOR CFD        | 0.94  | 0.91  | 0.96  |
| GuideScan 2.0      | High  | High  | High  |
| MIT Score          | 87    | 82    | 91    |

Top off-target sites for gRNA1 (all require 4+ mismatches):

- Site 1: chr2:45,678,901 (4 MM, intergenic, no gene within 50kb)
- Site 2: chr5:12,345,678 (4 MM, intron of non-expressed gene in liver)
- Site 3: chr8:98,765,432 (3 MM in seed + 1 MM distal, intergenic)

Risk assessment: All top off-target sites are in non-coding regions or genes not expressed in hepatocytes. Seed region mismatches in top sites significantly reduce cleavage probability.
