## Example Usage

### Input

Mental health self-rating: 6/10 on most days. Primary challenges: Work-related anxiety that carries into evenings, occasional depressive episodes lasting 2-3 days, tendency to overthink at night leading to poor sleep. Main stressors: Demanding job with high pressure, financial stress from recent expenses, relationship tension with partner about work-life balance. Current symptoms: Racing thoughts, difficulty relaxing, irritability with loved ones, interrupted sleep. Current coping: Exercise when I can manage it (inconsistent), talking to one close friend occasionally, sometimes watching TV to zone out. Support: Partner is understanding but frustrated, I see a therapist every few weeks when insurance allows. Goals: Better daily stress management, less anxiety spillover into personal life, more consistent emotional baseline. Available time: 20-30 minutes daily for self-care.

**Work-Partner Balance:**

- Establish signal for "I need transition time"

**Professional Support Note:**
Your intermittent therapy is valuable - consider whether current frequency meets your needs given stress levels. Share this self-care approach with your therapist; they can help refine it. If depressive episodes worsen or anxiety significantly impairs daily function, prioritize increasing professional support.
