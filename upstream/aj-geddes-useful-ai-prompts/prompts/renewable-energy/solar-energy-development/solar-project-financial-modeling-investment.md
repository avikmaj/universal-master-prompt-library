## Example Usage

### Input

We're structuring financing for a 150 MW solar project in ERCOT (Texas). The project has a 15-year PPA at $35/MWh with a creditworthy utility offtaker for 70% of output. The remaining 30% will be merchant exposure. Construction starts in 6 months with target COD in 18 months. We need to optimize the capital structure for a 70/30 debt-equity split with tax equity.

### Output

_LCOE calculation:_

- Unlevered LCOE: $28.50/MWh (highly competitive)
- Levered LCOE: $32.00/MWh (with financing costs)

**Revenue Structure and Optimization**

_Contracted revenue (70%):_

- PPA volume: ~228 GWh/year
- PPA price: $35/MWh with 1.5% annual escalation
- Year 1 revenue: $8.0M
- 15-year PPA NPV: $105M

_Merchant revenue (30%):_

- Merchant volume: ~97 GWh/year
- ERCOT price forecast: $38/MWh Year 1, declining to $32/MWh by Year 10
- Year 1 merchant revenue: $3.7M
- Merchant strategy: 50% hedged through forward contracts, 50% spot exposure

_Additional revenue streams:_

- Renewable Energy Credits: $3/MWh = $1.0M/year
- Ancillary services (future): Potential $0.5M/year with grid services capability

_Total Year 1 revenue: $12.7M_

_Revenue risk analysis:_

**Financing Timeline**

_Pre-construction (Months 1-6):_

- Month 1-2: Financial model finalization, term sheet negotiation
- Month 3-4: Due diligence (technical, legal, market, insurance)
- Month 5: Documentation negotiation, conditions precedent
- Month 6: Financial close, construction loan funding

_Construction (Months 7-18):_

- Monthly construction draws against milestone completion
- Tax equity funding at COD or substantial completion

_Operations (Month 19+):_

- Term loan conversion
- Tax equity flip (Year 6)
- Refinancing opportunity (Year 7-10)

**Investment Recommendation**

The project demonstrates strong investment fundamentals:

- **Competitive LCOE** ($28.50/MWh unlevered) positions well in ERCOT market
- **Contracted revenue** (70% PPA) provides cash flow stability
- **Attractive returns** (18% sponsor IRR) exceed hurdle rates
- **Manageable risk profile** with investment-grade offtaker and hedging strategy

Proceed with financing execution. Key focus areas:

1. Lock tax equity commitment before ITC step-down risk
2. Execute merchant hedge strategy for price protection
3. Complete EPC contracting with appropriate risk transfer
