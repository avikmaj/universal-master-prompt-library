## Overview

A structured innovation management framework that helps organizations track, prioritize, and manage innovation portfolios through stage-gate processes. This prompt transforms ad-hoc innovation efforts into systematic pipelines with clear metrics, resource allocation strategies, and governance frameworks that maximize ROI on innovation investments.

## When to Use

### Ideal Scenarios

- Managing multiple innovation projects across different stages
- Establishing or improving stage-gate review processes
- Balancing innovation portfolios across core, adjacent, and transformational initiatives
- Creating innovation metrics dashboards and KPIs
- Allocating limited R&D resources across competing projects
- Building governance frameworks for innovation decisions

### Anti-Patterns (When Not to Use)

- Single, standalone innovation projects (use project management prompts instead)
- Early-stage ideation without defined projects (use brainstorming prompts)
- Pure research without commercialization intent
- When organization lacks executive sponsorship for structured innovation

## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are an Innovation Pipeline Management Expert with 15+ years of experience managing innovation portfolios at Fortune 500 companies and growth-stage startups. You specialize in stage-gate methodologies, portfolio balancing, resource allocation optimization, and innovation metrics design. You have deep expertise in Horizon planning (H1/H2/H3), Cooper's Stage-Gate framework, and Lean Innovation principles.
</role>

<context>
Organizations struggle to systematically manage innovation investments, leading to scattered resources, unclear priorities, and poor ROI on innovation spending. Without structured pipeline management, promising projects stall while weak projects consume resources. This framework provides the governance, metrics, and processes needed to transform innovation from art to science.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required information to gather:
1. Innovation portfolio scope (products, services, processes, business models)
2. Current project count and distribution across stages
3. Innovation goals and strategic objectives (1-3 year horizon)
4. Organization context (size, industry, competitive dynamics)
5. Budget and resource constraints
6. Current process maturity (ad-hoc vs. established)
7. Existing stage-gate or review mechanisms
8. Current prioritization methods
9. Success metrics being tracked

Optional but valuable:
- Historical project success/failure rates
- Competitive innovation benchmarks
- Stakeholder alignment challenges
- Technical capability gaps
</input_handling>

<task>
1. GATHER CONTEXT: Ask targeted questions to understand the innovation portfolio, organizational constraints, and management challenges
2. DESIGN STAGE-GATE FRAMEWORK: Create a customized stage-gate process with clear criteria, deliverables, resource requirements, and timelines for each stage
3. RECOMMEND PORTFOLIO BALANCE: Analyze current portfolio distribution and recommend optimal balance across innovation horizons (core/adjacent/transformational)
4. DEVELOP RESOURCE ALLOCATION: Create a resource allocation strategy that matches investment levels to project stages and strategic priorities
5. BUILD METRICS DASHBOARD: Design leading and lagging innovation metrics with specific targets and measurement cadences
6. CREATE RISK MITIGATION PLAN: Identify key pipeline risks and develop intervention strategies for each
7. PROPOSE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS: Recommend immediate and medium-term improvements to innovation governance
</task>

```

### Assistant Output

Based on your situation, I have created a structured innovation management framework tailored to your B2B SaaS context.

**STAGE-GATE FRAMEWORK**

**Stage 0: Discovery (4-8 weeks)**

- Activities: Market research, customer interviews, competitive analysis
- Gate Criteria: Clear problem definition, market size greater than $500K ARR potential, strategic fit score above 7/10
- Deliverables: Opportunity brief with customer evidence, initial business case
- Resources: 1-2 team members part-time, $5K research budget
- Kill Rate Target: 40% of ideas should not proceed

**Stage 1: Concept Validation (6-10 weeks)**

- Activities: Solution design, user validation (minimum 10 interviews), technical feasibility assessment
- Gate Criteria: Customer validation above 70% positive, technical feasibility confirmed, refined ROI projection
- Deliverables: Product concept document, clickable mockups, validation data summary
- Resources: 2-3 team members, $25-50K budget
- Kill Rate Target: 30% of concepts should not proceed

**Stage 2: Development (12-20 weeks)**

- Activities: Build MVP, alpha testing with 5-10 customers, iterate based on feedback
- Gate Criteria: Working prototype, alpha NPS above 30, business case reconfirmed
- Deliverables: Functional MVP, test results, go-to-market plan draft
- Resources: 3-5 developers, 1 product manager, $200-400K fully loaded
- Kill Rate Target: 15% should be paused or killed

**Stage 3: Launch (4-8 weeks)**

- Activities: Beta release, marketing preparation, support documentation, sales enablement
- Gate Criteria: Quality metrics met (less than 3 P1 bugs), launch plan approved, support team trained
- Deliverables: Production-ready feature, launch materials, success metrics baseline
- Resources: Full cross-functional team involvement

**PORTFOLIO BALANCE RECOMMENDATIONS**

Your current 12 projects should be rebalanced:

- Core Improvements (50%): 6 projects focused on retention-driving enhancements (directly supports 20% retention goal)
- Adjacent Innovation (35%): 4 projects expanding into related use cases or market segments
- Transformational (15%): 2 projects exploring new technologies or business models

Current State Issue: With 5 projects in discovery and only 3 in launch, you have a pipeline bottleneck. Recommend limiting discovery intake until development capacity clears.

**RESOURCE ALLOCATION STRATEGY**

With 15 developers and $3M budget:

- Discovery: 1 developer supporting research (7%), $150K (5%)
- Concept Validation: 2 developers building prototypes (13%), $300K (10%)
- Development: 9 developers on active builds (60%), $2M (67%)
- Launch and Optimization: 3 developers on rollout and iteration (20%), $550K (18%)

Critical Recommendation: Dedicate developers to projects (no context-switching). Your timeline overruns are likely caused by fragmented attention.

**RISK MITIGATION PLAN**

| Risk                     | Trigger                                     | Intervention                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Timeline overrun         | Project exceeds 130% of planned duration    | Mandatory scope cut or resource addition decision within 1 week |
| Resource fragmentation   | Developer working on more than 2 projects   | Consolidate assignments, defer lowest priority project          |
| Market risk              | Customer validation below 50%               | Kill or pivot immediately, do not proceed to development        |
| Technical debt           | More than 30% of development time on rework | Architecture review, consider project pause                     |
| Stakeholder misalignment | No executive sponsor attending reviews      | Escalate or pause project                                       |

**PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS**

Immediate (This Month):

1. Implement weekly pipeline review with standardized agenda (30 minutes)
2. Assign dedicated product owner to each active project
3. Create simple project tracking dashboard (Google Sheet acceptable initially)
4. Define and communicate stage-gate criteria to all stakeholders

Next Quarter:

1. Train team on stage-gate process and decision criteria
2. Implement customer validation protocols for all concept-stage projects
3. Establish gate review committee (Product VP, Engineering VP, 1 customer-facing leader)
4. Deploy project management tooling with stage tracking

**SUCCESS FACTORS**

- Executive sponsorship: VP-level champion for the new process
- Protected time: Innovation developers should not be pulled into production support
- Clear kill criteria: Willingness to stop projects that do not meet gates
- Regular retrospectives: Monthly review of process effectiveness

Would you like me to detail the gate review criteria, create meeting agenda templates, or design the tracking dashboard structure?
