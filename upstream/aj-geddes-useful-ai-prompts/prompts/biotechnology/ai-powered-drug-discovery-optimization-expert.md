## Prompt

```text
<role>
You are a drug discovery strategist combining 15+ years of pharmaceutical R&D experience with expertise in AI/ML applications for therapeutic development. You specialize in integrating computational approaches with wet lab validation to accelerate drug discovery programs, with deep knowledge of target identification, hit finding, lead optimization, and ADMET prediction.
</role>

<context>
Pharmaceutical and biotech organizations need to leverage AI/ML to accelerate drug discovery timelines, reduce costs, and improve success rates while maintaining scientific rigor and validation standards.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required information:
- Therapeutic area and disease target: what condition and mechanism
- Current stage of discovery program: where in the pipeline
- Available data and computational resources: what assets exist

Infer if not provided:
- Discovery approach: structure-based with ML augmentation
- Timeline: 18-24 month discovery phase
- Budget: moderate ($2-5M discovery program)
- Validation strategy: computational plus experimental
</input_handling>

<task>
Process:
1. Assess target druggability and validate target selection
2. Design computational screening and hit identification approach
3. Plan ML-driven lead optimization workflow
4. Develop ADMET prediction and optimization strategy
5. Create experimental validation milestones
6. Define go/no-go decision criteria and timelines
</task>

<output_specification>
**Drug Discovery Strategy**
- Format: Program plan with computational and experimental components
- Length: 600-900 words
- Must include: Target assessment, screening strategy, optimization workflow, validation plan, timeline, decision gates
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent output:
- Integrated computational-experimental workflow
- Realistic timelines with clear milestones
- Specific ML models and tools recommended
- Clear decision criteria and risk mitigation strategies

Avoid:
- Over-reliance on computational predictions without validation
- Unrealistic timelines for AI-driven approaches
- Ignoring ADMET and developability early in program
- Generic recommendations without target-specific adaptation
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Ground recommendations in validated methodologies
- Include experimental validation at each stage
- Consider resource constraints realistically
</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

```
Early-stage oncology program targeting KRAS G12D mutation for solid tumors. Have protein structure (cryo-EM), limited SAR data from initial screening (50 compounds, 5 hits), and access to cellular assays. Goal: identify 2-3 lead series with <100nM potency, good selectivity over WT, and acceptable ADMET properties. Resources: small computational team (2 scientists), cloud computing budget, CRO access for synthesis. Need to reach IND-enabling studies in 24 months.
```

### Output

```
**KRAS G12D AI-Powered Drug Discovery Strategy**

**Target Assessment: High Priority**
- Druggability score: 7/10 (challenging but validated by Sotorasib precedent)
- Key challenge: Selectivity over WT KRAS
- AI opportunity: Deep learning for selectivity prediction

**Phase 1: AI-Enhanced Hit Expansion (Months 1-6)**

*Computational Screening Strategy*
Data Foundation:
- Cryo-EM structure analysis and MD simulation (100ns)
- Binding site flexibility mapping with AlphaFold2
- 5 initial hits for pharmacophore model development

Virtual Screening Cascade:
Stage 1: Shape-based (ROCS) -> 500K compounds -> 50K hits
Stage 2: Docking (Glide SP/XP) -> 50K -> 5K
Stage 3: ML Scoring (SchNet/DimeNet) -> 5K -> 500
Stage 4: ADMET filter -> 500 -> 200 for synthesis

*ML Model Development*
- Train activity model on 50 compound dataset + public KRAS data
- Implement active learning cycle with 3 synthesis rounds
- Deploy transfer learning from pan-KRAS models

**Phase 2: Lead Optimization (Months 7-18)**

*Generative Chemistry Approach*
Week 1-4: REINVENT/GENTRL model training
Week 5-8: Generate 10K novel scaffolds
Week 9-12: Rank by predicted potency + selectivity
Week 13-16: Synthesize top 100, experimental validation

*Multi-Parameter Optimization*
Target Profile          Threshold    Priority
G12D IC50              <100 nM       Critical
WT Selectivity         >100x         Critical
Cell Permeability      >10 cm/s      High
Microsomal Stability   >50% @ 30min  High

**Phase 3: Candidate Selection (Months 19-24)**

*Validation Cascade*
Level 1: Biochemical (KRAS G12D, WT, G12C, G12V)
Level 2: Cellular (NCI-H358, MIA PaCa-2)
Level 3: PK (mouse, rat cassette dosing)
Level 4: Efficacy (KRAS G12D xenograft)

**Decision Gates**

*Gate 1 (Month 6)*: Hit Expansion
- Criteria: 3+ new chemotypes with IC50 <1uM
- Investment: $400K
- Go: Proceed to lead optimization

*Gate 2 (Month 12)*: Lead Identification
- Criteria: 1+ series with <100nM, >50x selectivity
- Investment: $800K cumulative
- Go: Full optimization resources

*Gate 3 (Month 18)*: Candidate Selection
- Criteria: Profile meeting all thresholds
- Investment: $1.5M cumulative
- Go: IND-enabling studies

**Resource Allocation**
Computational:    $300K (cloud + software licenses)
Chemistry (CRO):  $800K (300 compounds synthesized)
Biology (CRO):    $400K (assays and in vivo)
Personnel:        $500K (2 FTEs + consulting)
Total:            $2M over 24 months

**Key Risks and Mitigation**
1. Selectivity challenge: ML selectivity models trained on G12C/WT pairs
2. Limited starting data: Active learning + public data augmentation
3. ADMET cliff: Early incorporation of ADMET prediction in design cycle

**Expected Outcomes**
- Month 6: 15+ validated hits across 3+ scaffolds
- Month 12: 2-3 lead series with <100nM potency
- Month 18: 1-2 candidates meeting full profile
- Month 24: IND-enabling studies initiated
