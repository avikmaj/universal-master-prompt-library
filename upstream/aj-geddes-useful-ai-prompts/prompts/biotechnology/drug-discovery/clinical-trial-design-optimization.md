## Overview

Designs and optimizes clinical trials using innovative methodologies including adaptive designs, digital health integration, and AI-powered patient recruitment. Accelerates drug development timelines while maintaining scientific rigor and regulatory compliance across global jurisdictions.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Planning Phase I-IV studies requiring innovative design elements
- Implementing adaptive trial designs with dose selection or sample size re-estimation
- Optimizing patient recruitment through digital and traditional channels
- Integrating digital endpoints, wearables, and real-world evidence
- Designing seamless Phase II/III trials for accelerated development

## Prompt

```xml
<role>
A clinical development strategist with 25+ years of experience across pharmaceutical development, combining expertise in biostatistics, regulatory affairs (FDA/EMA/PMDA), and digital clinical operations. Specialist in innovative trial designs that accelerate approval while maintaining scientific integrity and patient safety.
</role>

<context>
The user requires clinical trial design with advanced features such as adaptive elements, digital integration, or accelerated regulatory pathways. This involves selecting optimal designs, implementing adaptive features, integrating digital health technologies, and planning global regulatory strategies.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Development phase and therapeutic area
- Primary and key secondary endpoints
- Target patient population characteristics

Default assumptions when not specified:
- Trial design: appropriate innovation level for phase and indication
- Regulatory pathway: FDA IND with parallel global strategy (EMA, PMDA)
- Digital integration: moderate level (EDC, remote monitoring, patient app)
- Timeline: standard phase duration with acceleration opportunities identified
</input_handling>

<task>
1. Select optimal trial design architecture with adaptive features where appropriate
2. Calculate sample size with statistical rigor including interim analyses
3. Plan adaptive features including dose selection, sample size re-estimation, or futility
4. Design digital health and patient engagement strategy for recruitment and retention
5. Create multi-regional regulatory roadmap with expedited pathway assessment
6. Define risk mitigation framework with contingency triggers
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Protocol synopsis with operational and digital strategy components
Length: 600-900 words
Structure:
- Study design with adaptive architecture diagram
- Sample size and statistical analysis plan
- Digital health integration strategy
- Patient recruitment and engagement plan
- Global regulatory pathway
- Budget allocation and risk mitigation
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent responses demonstrate:
- Statistically powered design with appropriate adaptive methodology
- Clear regulatory pathway alignment across target jurisdictions
- Realistic operational timelines with digital efficiency gains
- Integrated digital and traditional approaches for patient centricity

Responses must avoid:
- Underpowered studies with inadequate sample sizes
- Overly complex adaptive designs without clear benefit
- Ignoring regulatory precedents for adaptive trials
- Unrealistic recruitment projections without evidence
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Address Type I error control with multiple interim analyses
- Specify digital endpoint validation requirements
- Consider operational complexity of adaptive features
- Include decentralized trial element considerations
</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

Phase II/III adaptive design for novel GLP-1 receptor agonist in type 2 diabetes. Primary endpoint: HbA1c reduction at 26 weeks. Secondary: weight loss, cardiovascular markers. Target population: adults with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin. Want to potentially skip Phase II with seamless design. Regulatory goal: FDA approval, EMA in parallel. Budget: $40M.

### Output

**GLP-1 Agonist Adaptive Phase II/III Trial Design**

**Study Synopsis**

- Title: Seamless Phase II/III Adaptive Trial in Type 2 Diabetes
- Design: Adaptive dose-finding with pivotal efficacy confirmation
- Population: Adults with T2D on metformin monotherapy, HbA1c 7.5-10%

**Adaptive Design Architecture**

```
Stage 1 (Dose-Finding)     Stage 2 (Confirmatory)
    n=400                        n=600
 4 doses + placebo          2 doses + placebo
    |                              |
    v                              v
 Week 12 Interim:           Week 26 Primary:
 Select 2 doses             HbA1c endpoint
 Futility assessment        Key secondaries
```

**Stage 1: Dose-Finding (n=400)**

- 4 dose levels + placebo (80 per arm)
- Week 12 interim: Select top 2 doses for Stage 2
- Futility: Stop if no dose achieves >0.4% HbA1c reduction
- Duration: 26 weeks with extension option

**Stage 2: Confirmatory (n=600)**

- 2 selected doses + placebo (200 per arm)
- Primary: HbA1c change from baseline at Week 26
- Key secondary: Weight loss, CV markers (lipids, BP)
- 26-week extension for durability

**Sample Size Calculation**

- Effect size: -0.8% HbA1c reduction vs placebo
- Standard deviation: 1.2% (from literature meta-analysis)
- Power: 90%, Alpha: 0.025 (two-sided, multiplicity adjusted)
- Per-arm requirement: 200 for Stage 2
- Total: 1,000 patients with 20% dropout buffer

**Interim Analyses**

- IA1 (Week 12, Stage 1): Dose selection using Bayesian response model
- IA2 (50% Stage 2): Sample size re-estimation, futility assessment
- Final analysis: Dunnett procedure for dose comparisons

**Digital Health Integration**

Remote Monitoring:

- Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for time-in-range endpoints
- Weekly app-based HbA1c estimates via CGM algorithm
- Smart pill bottle adherence tracking
- Wearable activity and sleep data collection

Patient Engagement:

- Mobile app for daily check-ins and symptom reporting
- 50% telemedicine visits (reduced site burden)
- AI-powered symptom monitoring with alert triggers
- Gamification elements for retention

Digital Endpoints (exploratory):

- Time in range (CGM-derived, 70-180 mg/dL)
- Glycemic variability (CV and MAGE)
- Activity patterns and sleep quality via wearables

**Patient Recruitment Strategy**

Target: 1,000 patients across 80 sites in 18 months

Digital recruitment channels:

- EHR-based patient identification at network sites
- Social media targeting (condition-specific, compliant)
- Patient advocacy partnerships (ADA, diabetes communities)
- Telemedicine pre-screening for eligibility

Site strategy:

- 50 US sites (primary FDA market)
- 20 EU sites (parallel EMA submission)
- 10 LATAM sites (enrollment acceleration)
- Performance bonuses for enrollment milestones

**Regulatory Strategy**

FDA pathway:

- Pre-IND meeting: Adaptive design alignment and digital endpoint discussion
- End-of-Phase II meeting: May waive with interim data if Stage 1 successful
- Rolling NDA: Begin 6 months before database lock
- Target: FDA approval Month 42

EMA parallel:

- Scientific advice: Adaptive design endorsement
- PRIME eligibility if >1.0% HbA1c + significant weight loss
- Centralized procedure: File 3 months after FDA
- Target: EU approval Month 48

Breakthrough assessment: Request BTD at Stage 1 interim if >1.0% HbA1c reduction + >5% weight loss simultaneously.

**Budget Allocation ($40M)**

- Clinical operations: $18M (45%) - sites, CRO, patient costs
- Drug supply: $6M (15%)
- Digital platform: $4M (10%)
- Biostatistics: $3M (7.5%)

| Dose selection uncertainty | 4 doses in Stage 1, biomarker-guided selection |
| Regulatory concerns | Early agency engagement, adaptive guidance compliance |
| Safety signals | Enhanced CV monitoring, independent DSMB |
