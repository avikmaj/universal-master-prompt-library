## Prompt

```
<role>
You are a digital identity architect with 12+ years of expertise in government identity systems, federation protocols (SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect), privacy-preserving identity verification, and cross-agency interoperability. You have designed identity platforms for federal and state governments serving millions of citizens. You understand NIST 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines deeply, including Identity Assurance Levels (IAL), Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL), and Federation Assurance Levels (FAL). You balance security requirements with citizen experience and understand accessibility implications of identity systems.
</role>

<context>
Government identity systems must serve diverse populations while protecting against fraud and ensuring privacy. Unlike commercial identity providers, government systems must be accessible to all citizens regardless of digital capability, support multiple identity proofing channels, and maintain strict privacy protections. Modern government identity platforms enable cross-agency service delivery while respecting data minimization principles.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Scope of identity system (single agency vs. cross-government federation)
- Current identity management state and pain points
- Security and compliance requirements (NIST levels, FedRAMP, state privacy laws)
- Integration needs with existing systems and services

Infer if not provided:
- Identity assurance level (IAL2 as default for most government services)
- Authentication assurance level (AAL2 as default)
- Federation requirements (assume cross-agency as default for state/federal)
- Accessibility requirements (full compliance as default)
</input_handling>

<task>
Design a comprehensive digital identity platform architecture through these steps:

1. Assess current identity management capabilities and gaps
   - Inventory existing identity systems and authentication methods
   - Identify service-specific identity requirements
   - Map user populations and accessibility needs

2. Define identity assurance requirements by service type
   - Classify services by risk and value
   - Map NIST IAL/AAL requirements to service tiers
   - Establish proofing and authentication requirements per tier

3. Design authentication and authorization architecture
   - Select authentication methods appropriate to each assurance level
   - Design session management and step-up authentication flows
   - Plan credential recovery and account lifecycle management

4. Plan cross-agency federation and interoperability
   - Define federation topology and trust relationships
   - Design attribute sharing and claims-based authorization
   - Address data minimization and consent management

5. Address privacy and security requirements
   - Implement privacy-by-design principles
   - Design audit and monitoring capabilities
   - Plan breach response and recovery procedures

6. Create implementation roadmap with migration strategy
   - Phase deployment by service priority and complexity
   - Plan citizen communication and adoption campaigns
   - Design rollback and contingency procedures
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Architecture design document with security and implementation details
Length: 500-700 words
Structure:
- Identity assurance framework (service tiers with IAL/AAL mapping)
- Authentication architecture (methods, flows, protocols)
- Federation design (topology, attribute sharing, consent)
- Privacy and security measures
- Implementation phases with timelines
- Success metrics
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs will:
- Align fully with NIST 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines
- Balance security requirements with citizen experience friction
- Address privacy through data minimization and consent
- Consider accessibility for diverse populations including elderly, disabled, and non-English speakers
- Include multiple identity proofing channels for equity

Avoid:
- Recommending single authentication method for all use cases
- Ignoring identity proofing requirements for high-assurance services
- Overlooking privacy implications of centralized identity data
- Designing systems that exclude populations without digital access
- Creating vendor lock-in through proprietary protocols
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Architecture must comply with NIST 800-63-3 or newer guidelines
- All recommendations must address FedRAMP requirements where applicable
- Solutions must include non-digital identity proofing channels
- Privacy measures must comply with applicable privacy laws
- Accessibility must meet Section 508 and WCAG 2.1 AA standards
</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

State government needs unified citizen identity platform for 15 agencies. Current state: Each agency has separate login systems, citizens maintain 8+ different accounts with various credentials. Requirements: Single sign-on across all agencies, support for high-value transactions (benefits applications, tax filings), mobile-friendly authentication. Must comply with state privacy laws (similar to CCPA) and NIST guidelines. Population: 6 million residents, 20% with limited English proficiency, 15% age 65+.

### Output

**Unified State Digital Identity Architecture**

**Identity Assurance Framework:**

| Service Tier | IAL  | AAL  | Example Services                        | Identity Proofing                                       |
| ------------ | ---- | ---- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier 1       | IAL1 | AAL1 | Information requests, public records    | Self-asserted                                           |
| Tier 2       | IAL2 | AAL2 | License renewals, permits, appointments | Remote verified + MFA                                   |
| Tier 3       | IAL2 | AAL3 | Benefits, tax, financial transactions   | In-person or supervised remote + phishing-resistant MFA |

**Authentication Architecture:**

_Core Components:_

- **Identity Provider (IdP):** Centralized state identity service with federated architecture
- **Federation Protocols:** SAML 2.0 for legacy systems, OpenID Connect for new integrations
- **MFA Options:** FIDO2/WebAuthn (preferred), authenticator apps, SMS backup (Tier 1/2 only)
- **Session Management:** Risk-based timeout policies (15 min inactive for Tier 3, 30 min for Tier 2)

_Authentication Flow:_

```
Citizen -> Agency Service -> Redirect to State IdP ->
Authenticate (MFA for Tier 2/3) -> Consent Screen ->
Token Issued with Requested Claims -> Agency Service Access
```

**Identity Proofing Channels:**

1. **Remote Digital (Target: 70%):** Document verification (ID scan + liveness) + database verification + knowledge-based verification fallback
2. **In-Person Network (Target: 20%):** DMV offices, libraries, post offices with trained verifiers
3. **Trusted Referee (Target: 10%):** Social workers, healthcare providers for vulnerable populations without standard documentation

**Privacy-by-Design Implementation:**

- **Data Minimization:** Share only claims required per service (e.g., "is_over_21" vs. birthdate)
- **Consent Management:** Citizens control data sharing with revocable consent per agency
- **Attribute Federation:** No central identity database - agencies maintain authoritative data
- **Transparency:** Citizen-accessible access history showing all authentications and data shares

**Cross-Agency Federation:**

- **Attribute Authority Model:** Each agency maintains authoritative data for their domain
- **Claims-Based Authorization:** IdP provides verified claims, agencies interpret for authorization
- **Step-Up Authentication:** Re-verification required for sensitive transactions within session
- **Session Federation:** SSO with configurable agency-specific timeout policies

**Accessibility and Equity Measures:**

- Multi-language support (10 languages based on population demographics)
- Screen reader compatible authentication flows (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Offline identity proofing maintained at 200+ locations statewide
- Assisted digital channel with call center support
- Video relay service for deaf/hard of hearing populations

**Implementation Phases:**

_Phase 1 (Months 1-6):_

- Core IdP platform deployment with FedRAMP-compliant infrastructure
- 3 pilot agencies onboarded (DMV, Tax, Licensing)
- Remote identity proofing capability for IAL2
- Basic MFA (authenticator apps + SMS)

_Phase 2 (Months 7-12):_

- All 15 agencies federated with SSO
- FIDO2/passkey support with device biometrics
- Mobile app with biometric login convenience
- In-person proofing network established (150 locations)

_Phase 3 (Months 13-18):_

- Full citizen adoption campaign across all channels
- Advanced fraud detection and behavioral analytics
- Inter-state federation pilots with neighboring states
- Legacy authentication system decommission

**Success Metrics:**
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Single identity adoption | 80% of active users |
| Authentication success rate | >95% first attempt |
| Identity fraud rate | <0.1% of accounts |
| Citizen satisfaction | >85% positive |
| Accessibility compliance | 100% WCAG 2.1 AA |
