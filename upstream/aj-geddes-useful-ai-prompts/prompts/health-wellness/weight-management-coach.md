## Example Usage

### Input

Goals: Lose 30 pounds, keep it off this time. Previous attempts: Keto worked initially (lost 20 lbs) but gained it back plus more when stopped. Tried calorie counting, felt obsessive. Current patterns: Skip breakfast, large dinners, snack at night when watching TV, eat out 3-4x/week. Exercise: Sporadic, start strong then stop. Constraints: Busy schedule, don't love cooking, stress eater.

### Output

**Weight Management Plan**

**Pattern Analysis:**

- Previous approach issue: Restriction + all-or-nothing = unsustainable
- Current challenge: Evening-heavy eating, emotional eating, inconsistent habits
- Key insight: You need flexible structure, not rigid rules

**Approach Philosophy:**
No foods are forbidden. Success comes from building better patterns, not eliminating foods. This isn't a diet with an end date - these are lifestyle habits you're building that happen to result in weight loss. Aim for consistency over perfection.

**Nutrition Strategy:**

_Meal Timing Restructure:_

- Add breakfast (protein-focused, 5-10 min prep)
- Moderate lunch (prevents evening starvation)
- Reasonable dinner (not compensating for skipped meals)
- Planned evening snack (addresses TV snacking intentionally)

_Eating Out Optimization (Keep 2-3x/week):_

- Choose restaurant, review menu in advance
- Protein + vegetables focus
- Portion awareness (take half home)
- Enjoy without guilt - it's planned

_Home Meals (Simple Options):_

- Batch prep proteins on Sunday
- Pre-made salads and easy vegetables
- Healthy frozen options for backup
- No elaborate cooking required

**Activity Plan:**

_Sustainable Exercise Approach:_

- Start with 2x/week only (build consistency first)
- Choose activities you don't hate
- 20-30 minutes is enough initially
- Add frequency only after 4+ weeks of consistency

_Daily Movement:_

- Walking (steps vs. formal exercise)
- Movement breaks during work
- Activity you'd do anyway (walking dog, stairs)

**Behavioral Strategies:**

_Evening/Stress Eating:_

- Planned snack: Choose in advance, portion, enjoy without guilt
- Pause before unplanned eating: "Am I hungry or stressed?"
- Alternative stress response: 10-minute walk, call friend, shower
- If you eat anyway: No guilt spiral, return to plan next meal

_Consistency Building:_

- One change at a time (add breakfast first)
- 2-week minimum before adding new habit
- Expect imperfect execution (80% is success)
- Weekly check-in, not daily weighing

**Progress Expectations:**

_Realistic Timeline:_

- Weeks 1-4: Building habits, minimal scale change
- Months 2-3: 4-8 pound loss (1-2 lbs/week average)
- Months 4-6: Continue gradual loss, habits solidifying
- Month 6+: Transition to maintenance mindset

_Non-Scale Progress:_

- Energy levels
- Clothing fit
- Relationship with food
- Consistency of habits

**Maintenance Planning:**

- Continue habits, not "finish diet"
- Gradual calorie increase once at goal
- Flexibility built in from start
- Regular check-ins with patterns

**Key Mindset:** This isn't a diet with an end date. These are lifestyle habits you're building that happen to result in weight loss.
