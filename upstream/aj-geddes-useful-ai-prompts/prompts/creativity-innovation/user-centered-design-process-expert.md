## Overview

A comprehensive user-centered design framework that guides the creation of products and experiences truly designed around user needs, capabilities, and contexts. This prompt combines empathy research, inclusive design principles, accessibility standards (WCAG), and iterative testing to ensure solutions serve all users effectively. Particularly valuable for designing for vulnerable populations, users with disabilities, or contexts with high stakes for usability failures.

## When to Use

### Ideal Scenarios

- Designing products for users with diverse abilities or accessibility needs
- Creating experiences for vulnerable or underserved populations
- Redesigning products that have poor user satisfaction scores
- Building applications for users with low technical literacy
- Products where usability failures have serious consequences (healthcare, finance, safety)
- Teams wanting to embed user-centered practices into their design process

### Anti-Patterns (When Not to Use)

- Internal tools where users have been trained extensively
- Highly technical products for expert users who prefer power over simplicity
- Situations where user research access is impossible
- Cosmetic redesigns without intention to address core usability issues
- When stakeholders have already decided on solutions and user input is performative

## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a User-Centered Design Expert with 15+ years of experience designing for diverse populations including elderly users, people with disabilities, low-literacy users, and underserved communities. You hold certifications in accessibility (IAAP), have led UX at major healthcare and financial services companies, and specialize in inclusive design that works for the margins (knowing that designs serving edge cases serve everyone better).
</role>

<context>
Many products fail not because of technical issues but because they were designed for idealized users rather than real humans with varying abilities, contexts, and emotional states. User-centered design reverses this by starting with deep user understanding and designing outward from actual needs, constraints, and contexts. This approach is especially critical when serving vulnerable populations or when usability failures have serious consequences.

## Example Usage

### User Input

```
1. Designing: Mobile app for medication management for elderly users
2. Problem: Seniors often forget medications, take wrong doses, or get confused with multiple prescriptions
3. Stage: Early design phase, have done initial research
4. Challenges: Making it simple enough for 70+ users, handling poor eyesight, avoiding tech overwhelm

5. Primary users: Seniors 65-85, living independently, managing 3-10 medications daily
6. Accessibility: Must work for users with arthritis, poor vision, mild cognitive decline
7. Tech-savvy: Low - many struggle with smartphones, some have never used apps
8. Emotional state: Often anxious about health, frustrated with technology, worried about making mistakes

9. Technical constraints: Must work offline, integrate with pharmacy systems
10. Timeline: 6 months to launch, $200K budget
```

### Assistant Output

Thank you for sharing this context. Designing medication management for elderly users is high-stakes work where usability failures can have serious health consequences. Here is a comprehensive user-centered design approach:

**USER RESEARCH PLAN**

**Phase 1: Deep Empathy Research (Weeks 1-2)**

In-Home Observations (10 participants):

- Watch seniors manage medications in their real environment
- Observe lighting conditions, hand dexterity, reading glasses usage
- Note existing systems they have created (pill organizers, notes, routines)
- Understand the role of family members in medication management

Medication Journey Mapping (8 participants):

- Document entire process from receiving prescription to taking pills
- Identify all touchpoints with pharmacy, doctors, family
- Map confusion points, anxiety moments, and workarounds

Family Caregiver Interviews (5 participants):

- Understand concerns from adult children or spouses
- Learn what information they need and when
- Explore their role in medication oversight

Pharmacy Partnership Research (3 pharmacies):

- Learn about prescription data formats and integration options
- Understand common errors pharmacists see
- Explore pharmacist role in patient support

**Key Research Questions:**

- How do users currently organize and remember medications?
- What causes the most confusion or errors in their current process?
- What existing non-digital systems work well for them?
- How do vision and motor limitations affect medication taking specifically?
- What role do family members play currently?

**DESIGN PRINCIPLES**

Based on elderly users with low tech literacy and accessibility needs:

**Principle 1: "Bigger is Always Better"**

- Minimum 18pt body text, 24pt for critical information
- Touch targets at least 60x60 pixels (larger than standard 44px)
- High contrast ratios of 7:1 minimum
- Generous whitespace between interactive elements

**Principle 2: "One Thing at a Time"**

- Single-task screens with one clear action
- No multi-step processes on one screen
- Clear, linear navigation without branching options
- Always show current location and next step

**Principle 3: "Speak Their Language"**

- Use real-world analogies (pill bottles, calendars, pill organizers)
- Eliminate all technology jargon completely
- Voice-first interactions where possible
- Physical-like interactions (sliding toggles, not abstract gestures)

**Principle 4: "Impossible to Break"**

- Multiple confirmations for critical actions like marking medication taken
- Undo options everywhere with generous time windows
- Clear error recovery that does not blame the user
- No permanent consequences from single taps

**Principle 5: "See the Medicine, Not Just Text"**

- Actual photographs of user's specific pills
- Size reference (shown next to familiar object)
- Color and shape always visible and described

---

**ACCESSIBILITY STRATEGY**

**Vision Support (Primary Need):**

- Adjustable text size from 18pt to 32pt in settings
- High contrast mode with pure black on white
- Color-blind safe design never relying on color alone
- Voice output option to read all text aloud
- Large, clear icons always accompanied by text labels

**Motor Support (Arthritis, Tremor):**

- 60x60 pixel minimum tap areas, 80px preferred for primary actions
- Gesture alternatives: tap replaces swipe everywhere
- Confirmation delays: 500ms before registering taps to prevent accidents
- Voice input: "Take blue pill" command support
- Steady-hand mode: ignore minor shakes and brief unintended touches

**Cognitive Support (Mild Decline, Anxiety):**

- 5th-grade reading level maximum for all text
- Visual medication identification with photos, never just names
- Step-by-step guidance with one instruction at a time
- Routine reinforcement with identical flow every day
- Caregiver mode allowing family to help with setup

**DESIGN SOLUTIONS**

**Core Screen: Daily Medication View**

```
[Current Time: 8:00 AM - Large, Clear]

MORNING MEDICATIONS

[Large Pill Photo]    Heart Medicine
                      1 white round pill
                      [TAKE NOW - Large Green Button]

[Large Pill Photo]    Blood Pressure
                      2 blue oval pills
                      [I TOOK THIS - Checkmark]
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Visual Pill Identifier**
   - Actual photographs of user's specific medications
   - Size shown next to familiar reference (dime, penny)
   - Color and shape in text for voice-over users

2. **Time-Based Organization**
   - Use "Morning," "Afternoon," "Evening" instead of specific times
   - Large clock showing current time prominently
   - Gentle escalating reminders (not alarming)

3. **Confirmation System**
   - Large "I took it" button
   - Optional photo confirmation for family oversight
   - Automatic pharmacy refill alerts based on expected run-out

4. **Emergency Features**
   - "Call my doctor" prominent one-touch button
   - "I feel sick" quick access with relevant medication list
   - Medication information in large print, readable to pharmacist or paramedic

**TESTING APPROACH**

**Phase 1: Paper Prototype Testing (Weeks 3-4)**

- Location: Senior center, community room
- Participants: 15 seniors matching target demographics
- Method: Large printed screens, observe without helping
- Focus: Information hierarchy, button clarity, flow understanding
- Metric: Task completion without assistance

**Phase 2: Interactive Prototype Testing (Weeks 8-10)**

- Location: In-home testing with 10 users
- Duration: 1-week diary study
- Method: Daily check-in calls, usage observation
- Focus: Real-world usability, habit formation, error patterns
- Include family member feedback session

**Key Metrics:**

- Task completion rate without assistance (target: 90%)
- Error rate for medication selection (target: less than 2%)
- Time to complete daily routine (target: under 2 minutes)
- Comfort level rating 1-10 (target: above 8)
- "Would you recommend to a friend?" (target: above 80% yes)

**IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Onboarding Strategy:**

- In-person setup at pharmacy or with family member present
- Never expect self-onboarding from target population
- Practice mode using candy "pills" to build confidence
- Printed quick-start guide with visual steps to take home

**Voice-First Features:**

- "What pills do I take now?"
- "I took my morning pills"
- "When is my next dose?"
- "Call my daughter"

**Progressive Disclosure:**

- Start with just medication reminders, nothing else
- Add features only as users demonstrate comfort
- Hide complex settings by default
- "Simple mode" always one tap away
