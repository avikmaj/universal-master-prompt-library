## Overview

Designs protein structure prediction and molecular modeling workflows for drug discovery and structural biology research. Integrates AI-based structure prediction (AlphaFold2, ESMFold) with molecular dynamics simulations and drug-target interaction analysis for therapeutic development.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Predicting structures for novel drug target proteins lacking experimental data
- Modeling protein-ligand interactions for virtual screening
- Analyzing binding sites and druggability assessment
- Understanding protein dynamics and conformational changes for drug design
- Preparing receptor structures for structure-based drug discovery

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Basic sequence analysis without structural context
- Experimental structure determination planning (X-ray, cryo-EM)
- Clinical applications requiring experimentally validated structures
- Protein engineering without structural modeling needs

- Validation approach: experimental data when available plus quality metrics
- Dynamics: MD simulation for flexible regions requiring conformational sampling
- Output: Publication-quality figures and PDB coordinate files
</input_handling>

<task>
1. Assess target suitability and set confidence expectations based on sequence features
2. Design prediction pipeline selecting appropriate methods for protein type and complexity
3. Plan validation and quality assessment using pLDDT, PAE, and experimental data
4. Implement molecular dynamics protocol for dynamic regions and conformational sampling

## Example Usage

### Input

Need to model a novel GPCR target for CNS drug discovery. Have human sequence (400 residues, Class A GPCR), no experimental structure available. Closest homolog has 35% identity (crystal structure exists). Want to understand: orthosteric binding site, allosteric sites, receptor activation mechanism. Plan to use models for virtual screening and lead optimization. Need high confidence in binding site residues.

### Output

**GPCR Structure Modeling: CNS Drug Discovery Target**

**Target Assessment**

- Sequence: 400 residues, Class A GPCR (rhodopsin-like)
- Best template: 35% sequence identity
- TM helix prediction: 7 confirmed via TMHMM
- Disordered regions: N-terminus (1-30), ICL3 (220-280) - exclude from binding analysis

**AlphaFold2 Confidence Expectations**

- TM helices: pLDDT >85 (high confidence, suitable for docking)
- Binding pocket: pLDDT >75 (good confidence, validate key residues)
- Loop regions: pLDDT 50-70 (use MD for refinement)
- N-terminus, ICL3: pLDDT <50 (exclude from structural analysis)

**Phase 1: Structure Prediction (Days 1-2)**
ColabFold with MMseqs2 MSA, 12 recycles for GPCR complexity, amber relaxation enabled. Generate 5-model ensemble with and without template guidance. Validation target: TM-score >0.7 against closest homolog, binding site RMSD <2A.

**Phase 2: Model Refinement via MD (Days 3-5)**
GROMACS setup with CHARMM36m force field, POPC bilayer membrane, TIP3P water at 150mM NaCl. Protocol: 5000-step minimization, 1ns NVT, 5ns NPT equilibration, 500ns production (3 replicas). Analyze RMSD stability, RMSF flexibility, and binding site volume consistency.

**Phase 3: Binding Site Analysis (Days 6-7)**
Orthosteric site: FPocket cavity detection, SiteMap druggability scoring. Expected: 300-600A3 volume, >0.7 druggability score. Allosteric sites: FPocket on MD trajectory for cryptic pockets, literature-guided Class A sites (vestibule, intracellular pocket, lipid-facing).

**Phase 4: Virtual Screening Preparation (Days 8-10)**
Ensemble docking using 5 representative conformations from MD clustering. Glide workflow: HTVS (1M to 100K), SP (100K to 10K), XP (10K to 1K), MM-GBSA rescoring top 500.

**Confidence for Drug Design**

- High (use directly): TM backbone, conserved binding residues, H-bonding capacity
- Moderate (MD-validated): Loop conformations, side chain orientations
- Low (treat cautiously): N/C-termini, ICL3, induced-fit poses

**Deliverables**

1. Refined PDB model, 2. Binding site report, 3. Druggability assessment, 4. MD trajectory files, 5. VS-ready receptor grids, 6. PyMOL sessions for figures
