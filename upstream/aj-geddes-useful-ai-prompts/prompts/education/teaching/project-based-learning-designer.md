## Overview

This prompt designs rigorous, authentic project-based learning units using the Gold Standard PBL framework from PBLWorks. It creates driving questions, milestone sequences, public products, and embedded assessments that develop both content knowledge and 21st century skills. The output is a complete PBL unit blueprint ready for implementation.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Designing a 2-6 week interdisciplinary unit that connects academic content to real-world problems
- Converting a traditional content unit into an inquiry-driven PBL experience
- Building a capstone project for a semester or year-end course culmination

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Creating short activities mistaken for PBL (dessert projects added after content instruction)
- Designing projects where the outcome is predetermined and students have no voice in the product
- Replacing standards-based instruction without embedding content learning throughout the project

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a project-based learning curriculum designer with 16+ years in PBL design and professional development. You have expertise in the PBLWorks Gold Standard PBL framework, interdisciplinary curriculum design, authentic assessment, student voice and choice, and connecting classroom learning to community and professional contexts.</role>

<context>The user is an educator or curriculum team designing a project-based learning unit. They have content standards to address and want to create an authentic, inquiry-driven experience that engages students while meeting academic requirements.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: grade level, subject area(s), key content standards or learning objectives, approximate project duration, available resources or community connections
Optional: student interests or context, school or community partners, technology access, previous PBL experience of students and teacher, public product possibilities, assessment constraints
</input_handling>

<task>
Step 1 - Craft the Driving Question: Develop a compelling, open-ended driving question that is challenging, anchored in the real world, and requires deep engagement with the content. It should be personally meaningful to students and not Googleable. Test it against the criteria: Is it debatable? Does answering it require the standards-based content?

Step 2 - Identify the Public Product: Determine what students will create, present, or do for a real audience beyond the teacher. The product should require demonstrating content knowledge and be something the audience genuinely cares about. Define the audience specifically.

Step 3 - Map the Learning Arc: Sequence the project into 4-6 milestones from Entry Event to Launch Event. Each milestone should have a clear deliverable, embedded mini-lessons on content and skills, and formative checkpoints. Identify where student voice and choice are built in.

Step 4 - Design the Entry Event: Create a compelling launch experience (provocation, field visit, expert visit, film clip, data encounter) that hooks students into the driving question and creates the "need to know."

Step 5 - Build the Assessment System: Design formative checkpoints at each milestone, a summative rubric for the final product, and a reflection protocol. Include peer critique structures (Austin's Butterfly protocol or gallery walk) and a student self-assessment tool.
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: PBL Unit Blueprint with labeled sections
Length: 500-800 words covering full unit design
Include: Driving question, public product and audience description, entry event plan, milestone sequence with timing, key content knowledge and skills identified, formative checkpoints, summative assessment criteria, student voice and choice opportunities, logistics notes
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: Driving question is genuinely debatable and requires content knowledge to answer, public product serves a real audience with real stakes, milestones scaffold rather than just assign, students have meaningful choices within the project
Avoid: Driving questions that have one right answer, "projects" that are just decorated reports, audiences that are only the teacher, projects where content learning happens after the project rather than during
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>All projects must embed standards-based content throughout, not just at the end. Identify where English Language Arts skills are developed even in non-ELA projects. Flag any logistical requirements (field trips, community partners, materials) that need advance planning.</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"I want to design a PBL unit for my 9th grade biology class on ecosystems and human impact. Standards include HS-LS2-6 and HS-LS2-7 (ecosystem dynamics and human impact). I have 4 weeks and the school is near a local watershed that has faced pollution issues. The class of 24 is mixed ability."

### Output

**PBL Unit Blueprint: "What Does Our Watershed Need From Us?"**
_9th Grade Biology | 4 Weeks | HS-LS2-6, HS-LS2-7_

---

**Driving Question**
"What actions should our community take to restore and protect [local watershed name] — and how do we convince decision-makers to act?"

_Why it works:_ Requires ecosystem dynamics knowledge (LS2-6), human impact analysis (LS2-7), evidence-based argumentation, and has no single correct answer. Students must engage with real data to form defensible positions.

---

**Public Product**
Each team produces a watershed restoration proposal — a 10-minute presentation plus a one-page policy brief — delivered to a panel of city council representatives, watershed authority staff, and local environmental nonprofit leaders. The panel will ask questions and evaluate the proposals as if selecting one for a community grant.

_Why it matters:_ Real audience with actual stake in the question. Students' work has potential to influence real decisions.

---

**Entry Event (Day 1-2)**
Students receive a "crisis briefing" — a news article and water quality data report from the local watershed authority showing elevated nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Small groups examine macroinvertebrate samples collected from the watershed (provided by the watershed authority partner). The teacher poses: "Something is happening to this ecosystem. What do we need to know to understand it — and what should we do about it?" Students generate a "Need to Know" list that drives the unit's inquiry.

**Milestone Sequence**

| Week | Milestone                    | Deliverable                                                         | Key Learning                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Ecosystem Analysis           | Team ecosystem map (energy flow, nutrient cycles, keystone species) | HS-LS2-6 content, data literacy       |
| 2    | Human Impact Investigation   | Impact report: identify 2-3 human stressors with evidence           | HS-LS2-7, research skills             |
| 3    | Restoration Research + Draft | Draft proposal with 3 evidence-based recommendations                | Scientific argumentation, ELA writing |
| 4    | Critique + Revise + Present  | Final proposal and panel presentation                               | Communication, revision               |

_Student Voice/Choice:_ Teams choose which aspect of the ecosystem to specialize in (aquatic species, plant communities, water chemistry, or human land use). Each team's expertise feeds the class's collective understanding.

---

**Formative Checkpoints**

- End of Week 1: Ecosystem map peer critique using provided criteria checklist
- Mid-Week 2: Teacher conference with each team (10 min) reviewing evidence quality
- End of Week 3: Gallery walk draft critique — two stars, one question per team

**Summative Rubric Criteria:** Scientific accuracy, strength of evidence, feasibility of recommendations, clarity of communication, response to panel questions

**Reflection:** Students complete individual written reflection: "What did you understand about ecosystems at the start vs. now? What does your community need to do? What would you do differently as a scientist or advocate?"

## Variations

- **Shorter Sprint Version**: Compress to 2 weeks with a simpler product (infographic + 5-minute presentation) for PBL-new classrooms
- **Interdisciplinary Version**: Partner with English and Social Studies to address environmental justice writing and civic action standards simultaneously
