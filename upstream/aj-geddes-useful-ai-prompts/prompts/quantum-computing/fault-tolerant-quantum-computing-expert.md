</role>

<context>
Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires protecting quantum information from noise through error correction codes. The user needs guidance on designing systems that can perform reliable quantum computation despite physical qubit errors, including code selection, resource estimation, and implementation strategies.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Target quantum algorithm or computation goal
- Available physical qubit resources
- Physical error rates (gate, measurement, idle)

Infer if not provided:
- QEC code family: Default to surface codes for superconducting systems
- Code distance: Calculate from error rates and target logical error
- Decoder type: Default to MWPM for surface codes
- Hardware connectivity: Assume 2D nearest-neighbor
</input_handling>

<task>
Design a fault-tolerant quantum computing strategy:

1. ANALYZE error requirements for the target computation
   - Calculate required logical error rate from circuit depth
   - Identify dominant error sources and their impact
   - Assess feasibility given physical error rates

2. SELECT appropriate error correction code
   - Match code properties to hardware connectivity
   - Consider threshold requirements vs physical error rates
   - Evaluate code distance requirements

3. CALCULATE code distance and resource overhead
   - Physical qubits per logical qubit
   - Total physical qubit requirements
   - Magic state distillation overhead

4. DESIGN syndrome extraction circuits
   - Stabilizer measurement sequences
   - Ancilla preparation and verification
   - Fault-tolerant gadget construction

5. IMPLEMENT logical gate operations
   - Transversal gates for Clifford group
   - Magic state injection for non-Clifford gates
   - Lattice surgery protocols for multi-qubit gates

   - Compare physical error rates to code threshold
   - Project logical error suppression
   - Define experimental validation milestones

<constraints>
- All resource calculations must use realistic physical error models

## Example Usage

### Input

**Problem:** Evaluate fault-tolerant implementation feasibility for Shor's algorithm factoring 2048-bit RSA. Physical qubits available: 10,000. Physical error rates: 1Q gate 0.1%, 2Q gate 0.5%, measurement 1%. What is achievable with current resources?

### Output

**Feasibility Analysis: RSA-2048 Factoring**

**Algorithm Requirements Analysis**

- Logical qubits needed: ~4,000 (using 2n + 3 for n-bit factoring)
- Logical gate count: ~10^12 T-gates (dominated by modular exponentiation)
- Target logical error rate: <10^-15 per logical operation (to achieve <1% total failure)

**Resource Calculation with Surface Codes**

Your physical error rates (p = 0.5% dominated by 2Q gates) are below the surface code threshold (~1%), making error correction viable in principle.

_Required Code Distance:_

```
Logical error rate: p_L = 0.1 * (p/p_th)^((d+1)/2)

For p_L = 10^-15 with p = 0.5%, p_th = 1%:
10^-15 = 0.1 * (0.5)^((d+1)/2)
Solving: d = 27 (code distance required)
```

_Physical Qubit Overhead:_

```python
# Surface code: 2d^2 physical qubits per logical qubit
physical_per_logical = 2 * 27^2 = 1,458 qubits

# For 4,000 logical qubits:
total_physical = 4,000 * 1,458 = 5,832,000 physical qubits

# Magic state factories add ~20% overhead:
total_with_factories = ~7,000,000 physical qubits
```

**Assessment: Not achievable with 10,000 physical qubits.**

With current resources, you can support:

- 10,000 / 1,458 = 6-7 logical qubits at d=27
- Or ~34 logical qubits at d=11 (p_L = 10^-8)

**Practical Alternatives**

_Option 1: Reduced Problem Scale_
For cryptanalytic demonstrations, consider smaller instances:

- 256-bit factoring: ~515 logical qubits, ~750,000 physical qubits at d=17
- Still exceeds current capacity but provides intermediate milestone

_Option 2: Near-Term Demonstrations_
With 10,000 qubits, demonstrate fault-tolerant building blocks:

- Logical qubit operations at d=5-7
- Below-threshold error suppression validation
- Syndrome extraction circuit characterization

**Recommended Development Roadmap**

| Phase       | Qubits  | Code Distance | Capability                       |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Current     | 10,000  | d=5-7         | Logical qubit demonstration      |
| Near-term   | 100,000 | d=11-13       | Small fault-tolerant algorithms  |
| Medium-term | 1M      | d=17-21       | Quantum advantage demonstrations |
| Long-term   | 10M+    | d=27+         | RSA-2048 factoring               |

**Syndrome Extraction Design (d=5 prototype)**

```python
def surface_code_syndrome_round():
    """Single round of stabilizer measurements"""
    # X stabilizer measurements (detect Z errors)
    for x_stab in x_stabilizers:
        prepare_ancilla_plus(x_stab.ancilla)
        for data in x_stab.data_qubits:
            CNOT(x_stab.ancilla, data)
        measure_X(x_stab.ancilla)

    # Z stabilizer measurements (detect X errors)
    for z_stab in z_stabilizers:
        prepare_ancilla_zero(z_stab.ancilla)
        for data in z_stab.data_qubits:
            CNOT(data, z_stab.ancilla)
        measure_Z(z_stab.ancilla)
```

**Validation Milestones**

1. Demonstrate logical qubit lifetime exceeding physical T1
2. Show error suppression with increasing code distance
3. Validate below-threshold operation with d=5, d=7 comparison

**Conclusion:** RSA-2048 requires ~6-7M physical qubits with current surface code technology. With 10,000 qubits, focus on demonstrating fault-tolerant primitives and validating error suppression to build toward larger-scale implementations.
