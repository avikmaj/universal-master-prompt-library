```

**Troubleshooting Decision Tree**

_Symptom: Sudden T1 Drop_

```
1. Check if single qubit or chip-wide
   - Single qubit: Likely TLS or local defect
     -> Wait 24h (TLS may relocate)
     -> Check qubit frequency for spectator TLS
   - Chip-wide: Environmental issue
     -> Verify fridge temperature
     -> Check magnetic shielding
     -> Inspect for ground loop

2. If persists >24h
   -> Re-anneal qubit (thermal cycle to 4K)
   -> If still degraded, consider alternative qubit
```

_Symptom: Increasing Two-Qubit Error_

```
1. Check single-qubit fidelities first
   -> If degraded, address 1Q calibration

2. Check qubit frequencies (Ramsey)
   -> Frequency drift indicates flux bias issue
   -> Recalibrate flux

3. Check two-qubit gate parameters
   -> CR amplitude may need recalibration
   -> DRAG coefficient drift

4. Check crosstalk levels
   -> May need pulse shaping update
```
