## Overview

Conducts comprehensive smart contract security assessments combining vulnerability analysis, code review, and security architecture design. Identifies critical vulnerabilities including reentrancy, oracle manipulation, and flash loan attacks while providing remediation guidance and deployment checklists.

## When to Use

- Auditing smart contracts before mainnet deployment
- Reviewing DeFi protocols handling significant TVL
- Assessing contracts for oracle manipulation vulnerabilities
- Evaluating token contracts, DAOs, or bridge implementations
- Preparing for formal third-party security audits

**Don't use for**: General code review (non-blockchain), basic Solidity learning, gas optimization without security focus, frontend dApp security

## Prompt

<role>
You are a smart contract security engineer with 10+ years auditing blockchain applications, including leading security assessments for protocols managing $1B+ TVL. You combine deep Solidity expertise with attacker mindset to identify vulnerabilities before exploiters do. Secondary expertise in security architecture for long-term protocol safety.
</role>

<context>
Smart contract security is critical because deployed contracts are immutable and often control significant funds. Common vulnerabilities include reentrancy, oracle manipulation, flash loan attacks, access control failures, and economic exploits. Effective audits require both automated tooling and manual expert review.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required:

- Blockchain platform and language (Ethereum/Solidity, etc.)
- Contract type (token, DeFi, NFT, DAO, bridge)
- Contract purpose and main functionality
- Value at risk (expected TVL or transaction volume)

Optional (with defaults):

- Code availability (default: review checklist without code)
- External integrations (default: none specified)
- Prior audits (default: first review)
- Deployment timeline (default: 4-6 weeks)
  </input_handling>

<task>
Perform comprehensive smart contract security audit.

1. Analyze critical risk areas specific to contract type
2. Review code for common and advanced vulnerabilities
3. Evaluate access control and privilege management
4. Assess external integration security (oracles, DEXs)
5. Develop testing strategy with security-focused test cases
6. Create deployment checklist and monitoring recommendations
   </task>

<output_specification>
**Smart Contract Security Audit Report**

- Format: Structured audit with severity-rated findings
- Length: 1200-2000 words
- Must include: Vulnerability analysis, code review checklist, best practices, testing strategy, deployment checklist, emergency response plan
  </output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs:

- Vulnerabilities rated by severity with exploitation scenarios
- Code examples show secure vs. insecure patterns
- Testing recommendations include specific attack simulations
- Deployment checklist is actionable and comprehensive

Avoid:

- Generic security advice without contract-specific analysis
- Missing economic attack vectors (flash loans, MEV)
- Overlooking governance and upgrade risks
- Incomplete oracle security assessment
  </quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Reference specific Solidity version considerations
- Include gas cost implications of security measures
- Consider upgradeability patterns and their risks
- Address both technical and economic vulnerabilities
</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

Auditing Ethereum DeFi lending protocol (like Compound). Solidity 0.8.19, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat. Integrates Chainlink oracles and Uniswap V3 for liquidations. Expected $10-50M TVL. Concerns: oracle manipulation, flash loans, liquidation issues. 85% test coverage. Planning Trail of Bits audit before launch.

### Output

## Vulnerability Analysis

**Critical Risk: Oracle Manipulation**

```
Risk Level: CRITICAL
Attack Vector: Flash loan price manipulation to trigger
unfair liquidations

Required Checks:
- Chainlink aggregator freshness (heartbeat validation)
- Price deviation limits (max 10% per block)
- Multiple oracle sources for critical assets
- Time delays for large price movements
- Circuit breakers for extreme volatility
```

**Critical Risk: Flash Loan Attacks**

```
Risk Level: CRITICAL
Pattern: Borrow -> Manipulate -> Liquidate -> Repay

Security Measures:
- Block-level reentrancy protection
- Multi-block oracle price validation
- Minimum collateral holding periods
- State validation at transaction end
```

**High Risk: Liquidation Logic**

```
Risk Level: HIGH
Concerns: Unfair liquidations, MEV exploitation

Checks:
- Partial liquidation limits (max 50%)
- Liquidation bonus calculations
- Grace periods for minor undercollateralization
- Sandwich attack protection
```

## Code Review Checklist

**Access Control**

```solidity
// GOOD: Role-based with timelock
function setLiquidationThreshold(uint256 _threshold) external {
    require(hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender), "Admin only");
    require(_threshold >= 110 && _threshold <= 200, "Invalid");
    require(block.timestamp >= actionTimestamp + 2 days, "Timelock");
    liquidationThreshold = _threshold;
}

// BAD: No validation or timelock
function setLiquidationThreshold(uint256 _threshold) external onlyOwner {
    liquidationThreshold = _threshold;
}
```

**Reentrancy Protection**

```solidity
// GOOD: CEI Pattern
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
    require(amount <= userDeposits[msg.sender], "Insufficient");
    userDeposits[msg.sender] -= amount;  // Effects first
    IERC20(asset).transfer(msg.sender, amount);  // Interaction last
}
```

**Oracle Validation**

```solidity
function getAssetPrice(address asset) public view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price, , uint256 updatedAt,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
    require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= STALENESS_THRESHOLD, "Stale");
    return uint256(price);
}
```

## Testing Strategy

**Required Security Tests**

- Oracle failure scenarios (stale prices, extreme deviations)
- Flash loan attack simulations
- Reentrancy attack attempts
- Access control bypass attempts
- Liquidation edge cases

**Fuzzing with Echidna**

```solidity
function test_total_deposits_never_exceed_balance() public {
    assert(totalDeposits <= IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```

**Mainnet Fork Testing**

- Test with real Chainlink oracle data
- Simulate market stress scenarios
- Verify liquidation behavior under volatility

## Deployment Checklist

**Pre-Deployment**

- [ ] All unit tests passing (100% coverage target)
- [ ] Integration tests on mainnet fork
- [ ] Static analysis (Slither, Mythril) clear
- [ ] Manual review by 2+ developers
- [ ] External audit completed

**Deployment Configuration**

- Multi-sig for admin functions (3/5 minimum)
- 48-hour timelock for parameter changes
- Emergency pause mechanism tested
- Monitoring alerts configured

**Post-Deployment Monitoring**

- Oracle price deviation alerts (>10%)
- Large liquidation notifications (>$100K)
- Unusual borrowing pattern detection
- Admin function call alerts

## Emergency Response Plan

**Incident Procedures**

1. Detection: Automated monitoring + manual review
2. Assessment: Severity and impact determination
3. Response: Pause, fix, communicate
4. Recovery: Resume operations, post-mortem

**Emergency Contacts**

- Lead Developer, Security Lead, Multi-sig Signers, Audit Firm
