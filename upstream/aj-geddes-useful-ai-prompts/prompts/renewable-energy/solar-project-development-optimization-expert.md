## Example Usage

### Input

We're developing a 200 MW solar project in Texas (ERCOT). Site is greenfield agricultural land. Need to achieve commercial operation in 36 months. Key challenges are interconnection queue position and PPA negotiations in competitive market.

### Output

**Development Optimization: 200 MW Texas Solar**

**Site Assessment**

The Texas site offers favorable development characteristics:

- Land: Greenfield agricultural with minimal constraints
- Resource: 5.5+ kWh/m2/day GHI typical for central Texas
- Access: Evaluate road access for construction equipment
- Constraints: Agricultural land conversion straightforward in most Texas counties

**Interconnection Strategy**

ERCOT interconnection is the primary schedule risk:

- Queue position: Critical - evaluate current queue status and study timeline
- Study process: Screening study (60 days) + full interconnection study (120+ days)
- Network upgrades: Budget $8-15M contingency for transmission upgrades
- Timeline optimization: Submit complete application, engage ERCOT early

_Recommended approach:_

- Secure queue position immediately if not already held
- Budget 18-24 months for interconnection process
- Identify alternative POI if primary has excessive upgrade costs
- Monitor ERCOT reform proposals that may affect queue

**Permitting Strategy**

Texas offers streamlined permitting for solar:

- County level: Conditional use permit or by-right depending on county
- State level: No ERCOT certificate required for solar
- Environmental: NEPA not required for private land; conduct Phase I ESA
- Federal: FAA notice if near airports; FWS consultation if habitat concerns

_Timeline:_

- Months 1-3: County pre-application, environmental baseline
- Months 4-9: CUP application and approval
- Months 10-12: Building permits concurrent with construction start

**Offtake Strategy**

ERCOT market presents both opportunity and risk:

_PPA approach:_

- Target corporate offtakers (tech, industrial) seeking Texas solar
- Competitive PPA pricing: $22-28/MWh for quality projects
- Contract structure: 10-15 year term with escalation
- Credit: Investment-grade or LC/parent guarantee

_Merchant exposure:_

- ERCOT wholesale exposure for uncontracted portion
- Consider 70/30 contracted/merchant split
- Hedge strategy: Physical PPAs + financial hedges

_Competitive positioning:_

- Differentiate on development readiness (permits, interconnection)
- Offer flexible contract structures
- Demonstrate execution capability

**Financial Structure**

_Capital budget estimate:_

- Hard costs: $0.70-0.80/W ($140-160M)
- Soft costs: $0.08-0.12/W
- Interconnection: $15-25M (contingent on upgrades)
- Total: $175-205M

_Recommended structure:_

- Construction debt: 65-70% of cost
- Tax equity: 20-25%
- Sponsor equity: 10-15%
- ITC: 30% (ensure safe harbor compliance)

_Target returns:_

- LCOE: <$30/MWh
- Sponsor IRR: 12-15%
- DSCR: 1.30x minimum

**Development Roadmap**

| Phase               | Timeline     | Key Milestones                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1: Foundation | Months 1-12  | Site control, interconnection application, environmental studies |
| Phase 2: De-risking | Months 13-24 | LGIA execution, permits secured, PPA negotiation                 |
| Phase 3: Execution  | Months 25-36 | Financial close, construction, COD                               |

_Decision gates:_

- Month 6: Proceed/pause based on interconnection study results
- Month 18: FID contingent on offtake + permits
- Month 30: COD readiness confirmation

**Risk Mitigation**

| Risk                   | Probability | Mitigation                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Interconnection delays | High        | Early ERCOT engagement, study contingency |
| PPA pricing pressure   | Medium      | Multi-offtaker strategy, cost discipline  |
| Upgrade costs          | Medium      | POI flexibility, budget contingency       |
| Permitting delays      | Low         | Early stakeholder engagement              |

_Key success factors:_

1. Secure interconnection early - this drives schedule
2. Maintain cost discipline for competitive PPA positioning
3. Build offtaker relationships throughout development
4. Execute permits in parallel with interconnection

**Recommendation**

Project is viable with 36-month timeline if interconnection is actively managed. Prioritize ERCOT engagement and secure queue position. Begin PPA marketing immediately to build offtaker pipeline. Target $25/MWh or below to remain competitive in ERCOT market.
