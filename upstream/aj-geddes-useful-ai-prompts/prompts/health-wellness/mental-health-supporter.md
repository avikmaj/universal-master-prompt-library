## Example Usage

### Input

Current wellbeing rating: 5/10 on most days. Main stressors: Job pressure and deadlines, ongoing tension in relationship with partner, general feeling of being overwhelmed by everything. Current coping: Trying to push through it, exercise occasionally when I can motivate myself, sometimes vent to friends. Challenges: Really hard to relax even when I have time, my mind is always racing with what I should be doing, I feel guilty when I take time for myself instead of being productive. Goals: Feel more calm day-to-day, handle stress better without snapping at people, have more energy for things I actually enjoy.

### Output

**Mental Wellness Support Plan**

**Current Strengths and Resources:**

- Self-awareness about what's affecting you
- Access to social support (friends for venting)
- Exercise as an existing resource (even if inconsistent)
- Clear goals for improvement
- Desire to change (the most important ingredient)

**Reframe: Self-Care as Foundation:**
The guilt you feel about taking time for yourself is actually making stress worse. Self-care isn't selfish or unproductive - it's the foundation that enables you to show up for work, relationships, and everything else. You can't pour from an empty cup.

**Core Coping Techniques:**

_For Racing Mind:_

- **Brain dump:** Write everything on your mind without editing (5 minutes). Getting it out of your head reduces mental load.
- **Scheduled worry time:** Give yourself 15 minutes daily to worry intentionally, then practice redirecting outside that time.
- **Thought labeling:** "That's a work worry." "That's relationship stress." Naming thoughts creates distance.

_For Feeling Overwhelmed:_

- **One thing at a time:** Choose just the next single action, nothing beyond that.
- **2-minute rule:** If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it now to reduce mental clutter.
- **Permission statement:** "I'm doing enough. I am enough."

_For Difficulty Relaxing:_

- **Body-first approach:** Progressive muscle relaxation works even when mind won't quiet (tense and release each muscle group).
- **Movement as transition:** A short walk between activities signals "shift" to your nervous system.
- **Sensory grounding:** 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you feel - anchors to present moment.

**Daily Practices (15-20 minutes total):**

_Morning (5 minutes):_

- 3 slow, deep breaths before getting out of bed
- Set one realistic intention for the day (a way of being, not a task)
- Brief stretch or movement (even 2 minutes counts)

_Evening (10-15 minutes):_

- Decompression activity (walk, shower, music - something that signals "work is done")
- Write 3 small wins from the day (counters negativity bias)
- Brief relaxation practice (breathing, body scan, stretching)

**Permission Practice:**
Start telling yourself: "It's okay to rest. It's okay to not be productive. My worth isn't measured by my output." This is practice, not instant belief - repetition builds new patterns.

**Support Strategies:**

- Identify one friend for regular check-ins (not just crisis venting)
- Consider what conversation with partner about stress might look like
- Notice when "pushing through" is depleting rather than helping

**Progress Indicators (4 weeks):**

- Able to take breaks without significant guilt (sometimes)
- Racing thoughts less frequent or less consuming
- At least one truly enjoyable activity per week
- Slightly improved sleep or energy

**Professional Support Note:**
If stress or emotional challenges significantly impact daily functioning, relationships, or persist despite self-care efforts, professional support (therapy, counseling) can provide deeper help. This is a strength, not a weakness. Consider whether this level of support might be helpful for you.
