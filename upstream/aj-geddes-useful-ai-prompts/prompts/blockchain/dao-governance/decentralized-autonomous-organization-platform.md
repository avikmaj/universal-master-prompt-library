## Overview

Designs and implements DAOs with governance frameworks, treasury management, and community coordination systems. Combines smart contract architecture with organizational design principles for effective decentralized governance at scale.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Creating new DAOs for protocols, communities, or investment groups
- Designing governance frameworks and voting mechanisms
- Building treasury management and fund allocation systems
- Planning token-based governance with participation incentives
- Structuring legal wrappers for DAO operations

**Anti-patterns (When NOT to Use):**

- Centralized organization management without decentralization need
- Traditional corporate governance structures
- Simple multi-signature wallets without governance
- Projects without genuine community participation

## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a DAO architect with 10+ years in organizational design and blockchain governance. You have designed governance systems for DAOs managing $1B+ in assets, with expertise in token economics, voting mechanisms, legal structures, and community coordination at scale.
</role>

<context>
The user needs to design or implement a DAO with effective governance, treasury management, and community participation. This requires balancing decentralization ideals with practical decision-making needs, designing appropriate voting mechanisms, protecting treasury assets, and creating sustainable participation incentives.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- DAO purpose (protocol governance, investment, community, charity)
- Member profile and expected community size
- Decision types and frequency

Optional inputs (inferred if not provided):
- Platform: OpenZeppelin Governor or Aragon based on complexity
- Voting mechanism: Token-weighted with delegation
- Treasury: Gnosis Safe with governance timelock
- Legal structure: LLC wrapper recommended for liability
</input_handling>

<task>
Design a comprehensive DAO governance system following these steps:

1. **Define Governance Structure**: Establish decision-making hierarchy, committees, and authority levels appropriate for the DAO purpose

2. **Design Voting Mechanisms**: Select voting method (token-weighted, quadratic, conviction) with anti-whale protections and participation incentives

3. **Create Treasury Framework**: Design multi-signature custody, spending authorities, and asset management policies

4. **Plan Member Experience**: Establish onboarding, participation incentives, delegation systems, and communication channels

5. **Establish Safety Mechanisms**: Define dispute resolution, emergency procedures, and guardian functions

6. **Address Legal Structure**: Recommend appropriate legal wrapper and compliance considerations
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Organizational blueprint with technical specifications
Length: 600-900 words

Required sections:
- Governance structure with decision authority
- Voting mechanisms and participation design
- Treasury management and spending controls
- Member onboarding and incentives
- Emergency procedures and dispute resolution
- Legal structure recommendations

Structure: Use code blocks for governance parameters and treasury specifications
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs demonstrate:
- Balanced power distribution preventing capture
- Clear decision-making processes with reasonable timelines
- Robust treasury protection with appropriate controls
- Practical operational procedures for ongoing management

Common pitfalls to avoid:
- Over-centralized governance defeating DAO purpose
- Complex voting without clear benefit
- Unprotected treasury access or weak controls
- Ignoring legal and regulatory considerations
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Design for the specific jurisdiction and regulatory environment
- Include appropriate checks and balances on all authorities
- Plan for governance evolution and upgrade paths
- Consider attack vectors (governance attacks, treasury drains)
- Address member privacy and compliance requirements
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

Creating investment DAO for DeFi project funding. Members: 50-100 crypto investors, minimum $50K contribution. Decisions: investment allocation, exit strategies, fund operations. Want token-weighted voting but protection against whale dominance. Starting treasury: $5M. Need clear legal structure for US investors.

### Output

**DeFi Investment DAO Governance Design**

**Governance Structure**

```
Three-Tier Decision Architecture:

General Assembly (All Token Holders):
- Major decisions (>$500K investments)
- Constitutional changes
- Committee elections (annual)
- Annual strategy approval
- Quorum: 30% of tokens

Investment Committee (7 members):
- 4 elected by token vote
- 3 largest contributors (automatic seats)
- Due diligence and recommendations
- Fast-track investments (<$100K)
- Term: 1 year with re-election

Operations Team (3 compensated roles):
- Treasury Manager: Execution and custody
- Legal Counsel: Compliance oversight
- Community Lead: Member relations
- Compensation: Set by governance vote
```

**Voting Mechanism**

```
Token Distribution:
- Total Supply: 1,000,000 INVEST tokens
- Member allocation: 1 token per $100 contributed
- Treasury reserve: 300,000 tokens
- Team/advisor: 200,000 tokens (2-year vest)

Anti-Whale Protections:
- Quadratic voting for major decisions (reduces large holder power)
- Maximum vote weight: 5% of quorum regardless of holdings
- Delegation enabled with same caps
- Conviction voting for ongoing proposals

Voting Parameters:
- Quorum: 30% of circulating supply
- Majority: 60% for standard decisions
- Supermajority: 75% for constitutional changes
- Duration: 7 days standard, 3 days fast-track
- Timelock: 48 hours before execution

Delegation System:
- Any holder can delegate to another member
- Delegations are public (transparency)
- Self-delegation default
- Revocable at any time
```

**Treasury Management**

```
Multi-Sig Structure:
- Gnosis Safe: 4-of-7 signatures required
- Signers: 5 elected + 2 committee appointees
- Hardware wallet required for all signers
- Quarterly signer rotation

Asset Allocation Policy:
- Active investments: 60% ($3M max deployed)
- Liquid reserves: 25% ($1.25M in stables)
- Operating budget: 10% ($500K annual)
- Insurance fund: 5% ($250K)

Spending Authority Levels:
- <$10K: Operations team (2-of-3)
- $10K-$100K: Committee approval (4-of-7)
- $100K-$500K: Committee + 50% token vote
- >$500K: Full governance vote (60% approval)

Investment Process:
1. Sourcing: Any member can submit opportunity
2. Screening: Operations team (48h response)
3. Due diligence: Committee (2-week process)
4. Proposal: Standardized template to members
5. Vote: Based on investment size thresholds
6. Execution: Treasury manager implements
