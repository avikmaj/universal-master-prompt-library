## Example Usage

### Input

We're building a 150 MW DC / 120 MW AC solar project using single-axis trackers and central inverters. Site is 800 acres in a rural area with some wetland constraints. Schedule target is 10 months from notice to proceed to commercial operation. Main challenges: aggressive schedule, wet weather risk, and ensuring we meet performance guarantees for the financing parties.

### Output

**Solar Construction and Commissioning Framework: 150 MW Single-Axis Tracker Project**

**Construction Sequencing Strategy**

_Critical Path Analysis_
Your 10-month schedule is aggressive for 150 MW. Critical path runs through:

1. Electrical infrastructure (trenching, MV collection, substation)
2. Tracker installation and module mounting
3. Inverter installation and commissioning
4. Grid synchronization and performance testing

_Parallel Work Streams_
Maximize schedule compression through parallel activities:

- Civil grading and tracker foundations simultaneous in different zones
- MV trenching follows tracker foundation completion by 2-3 weeks
- String installation can begin before all trackers complete
- Commissioning testing overlaps with construction in completed areas

_Zone Approach_
Divide 800 acres into 5-6 construction zones:

- Complete zones fully before moving crews
- Enables rolling commissioning as zones finish
- Manages wetland areas as separate zones with specific constraints
- Allows early energization of completed sections

**Schedule Framework**

_Months 1-2: Site Preparation_

- Site mobilization and laydown areas
- Access roads and perimeter fencing
- Grading and drainage in initial zones
- Substation foundation and grounding grid start

_Months 3-5: Tracker and Electrical Infrastructure_

- Pile driving and tracker assembly (peak workforce)
- MV cable trenching and conductor installation
- Inverter pad construction and equipment setting
- Substation equipment installation

_Months 6-8: Module Installation and Wiring_

- Module installation (200,000+ modules)
- DC string wiring and combiner installation
- Tracker motor and controller installation
- MV cable terminations and testing

_Months 9-10: Commissioning and COD_

- Inverter commissioning and grid synchronization
- Performance testing and reliability demonstration
- Utility acceptance and final interconnection
- Commercial operation and handover

**Quality Control Program**

_Pre-Construction_

- Vendor factory inspections (modules, inverters, trackers)
- Incoming material inspection and documentation
- ITP (Inspection and Test Plan) development
- Third-party inspector engagement

_During Construction_

- Foundation depth and alignment verification
- Torque verification on structural connections
- DC string testing before backfill (continuity, polarity, Voc, Isc)
- MV cable testing (hi-pot, insulation resistance)
- Tracker alignment and range of motion verification

_Hold Points (Required Inspection Before Proceeding)_

- Pile depth verification
- Grounding system inspection before backfill
- DC string testing before energization
- MV cable testing before backfill
- Inverter energization approval

**Safety Management**

_Key Hazards_

- Electrical (arc flash, shock from DC systems)
- Material handling (modules, cable, equipment)
- Mobile equipment (excavators, cranes, delivery trucks)
- Weather (heat illness, lightning, wind)
- Wildlife (snakes, insects in rural areas)

_Program Elements_

- Daily safety briefings with crew sign-in
- Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) for each activity
- Lockout/tagout program for electrical work
- Competent person for electrical, excavation, rigging
- Heat illness prevention program
- Emergency action plan with local emergency services

_Performance Targets_

- TRIR < 1.0
- Daily safety observations by all supervisors
- Weekly safety walks with leadership

**Commissioning Protocol**

_Level 1: Component Testing_

- String-level I-V curve tracing

- Availability demonstration (typically 30-90 days)
- Thermal imaging of array under load

**Grid Interconnection Coordination**

_Pre-Synchronization_

- Pre-parallel inspection by utility
- Metering verification and certification
- Communication testing with utility control center

_Initial Synchronization_

- Coordinate with utility for first sync window
- Start with single inverter, add incrementally
- Verify protection operation at low power levels
- Confirm SCADA data flowing correctly

_Performance Demonstration_

- Meet utility capacity test requirements
- Demonstrate ramp rate and curtailment compliance
- Complete reliability run (typically 2-4 weeks)
- Address any punch list items

**Wet Weather Contingency**

Given your wetland constraints and weather risk:

- Maintain aggregate stockpile for road maintenance
- Matting for sensitive area access
