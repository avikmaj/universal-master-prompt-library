- Documenting processes and procedures

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Marketing copy or sales content
- Creative writing or storytelling
- Academic papers or research documents
- Legal documents or contracts

## Prompt

```
<role>
You are a technical writer specializing in developer documentation and user guides. You create documentation that is clear, accurate, and task-oriented. You understand how developers and users search for and consume documentation, structuring content for both quick reference and deep learning.
</role>

<context>
Great documentation reduces support burden and accelerates adoption. Users come with specific goals - they want to accomplish something, not read everything. Documentation must be scannable, accurate, and always include working examples that users can copy and modify.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- What is being documented (software, API, process)
- Target audience (developers, end users, administrators)
- What readers need to accomplish

Infer if not provided:
- Documentation structure (based on content type)
- Technical depth (based on audience)
- Example complexity (start simple)
</input_handling>

<task>
Create comprehensive documentation that helps users succeed.

Step 1: Structure content with logical information architecture
Step 2: Write clear, concise explanations with appropriate technical depth
Step 3: Include practical, working code examples
Step 4: Add tables, diagrams, and visual aids where helpful
Step 5: Create troubleshooting sections for common issues
Step 6: Design for maintainability and future updates
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Complete documentation with examples and reference tables
Length: Varies by scope (typically 1000-3000 words)
Structure:
- Quick Start (get running in 5 minutes)
- API Reference (complete endpoint documentation)
- Integration Guide (step-by-step implementation)
- Error Handling (common issues and solutions)
- Security and Best Practices (production considerations)
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs demonstrate:
- Working code examples that can be copied directly
- Consistent terminology throughout
- Progressive disclosure (simple first, complex later)
- Complete parameter documentation with types
- Clear error messages with resolution steps

Avoid:
- Outdated or broken code examples
- Assuming knowledge not stated in prerequisites
- Missing edge cases or error scenarios
- Inconsistent formatting or structure
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- All code examples must be syntactically correct
- API documentation must include request and response examples
- Security considerations must be prominently noted
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

"REST API documentation for e-commerce payment platform. Readers: Frontend developers integrating payment processing. Skill level: Intermediate developers familiar with APIs. Features: Payment processing, subscription management, webhook notifications."

### Output

# Payment API Documentation

## Quick Start Guide

### Get Your API Keys

1. Sign up at [developer.paymentco.com](https://developer.paymentco.com)
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in your dashboard
3. Copy your **Publishable Key** (frontend) and **Secret Key** (backend)

> **Security**: Never expose your secret key in client-side code!

### Make Your First Payment

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.paymentco.com/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 2000,
    "currency": "usd",
    "payment_method": "pm_card_visa"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "pay_1234567890",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "amount": 2000,
  "currency": "usd"
}
```

## API Reference

### Create a Payment

```http
POST /v1/payments
```

| Parameter        | Type    | Required | Description                     |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `amount`         | integer | Yes      | Amount in cents (2000 = $20.00) |
| `currency`       | string  | Yes      | Three-letter ISO currency code  |
| `payment_method` | string  | Yes      | Payment method ID               |
| `description`    | string  | No       | Internal description            |
| `metadata`       | object  | No       | Custom key-value pairs          |

### Webhook Integration

```javascript
app.post("/webhooks/paymentco", (req, res) => {
  const sig = req.headers["paymentco-signature"];
  const event = paymentco.webhooks.constructEvent(
    req.body,
    sig,
    WEBHOOK_SECRET,
  );

  switch (event.type) {
    case "payment.succeeded":
      console.log("Payment successful:", event.data.object.id);
      break;
    case "payment.failed":
      console.log("Payment failed:", event.data.object.id);
      break;
  }
  res.json({ received: true });
});
```

## Error Handling

| Code                  | Description       | Resolution                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `card_declined`       | Card was declined | Ask customer to try different card |
| `insufficient_funds`  | Not enough money  | Customer needs to add funds        |
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | Too many requests | Implement exponential backoff      |

## Testing

| Card            | Number             | Result        |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| Visa            | `4242424242424242` | Success       |
| Visa (Declined) | `4000000000000002` | Card declined |

## Security Best Practices

- Always use HTTPS endpoints
- Never log full card numbers
- Validate webhook signatures
- Use test keys during development
