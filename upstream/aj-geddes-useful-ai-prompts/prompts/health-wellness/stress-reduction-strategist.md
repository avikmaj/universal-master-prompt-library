## Example Usage

### Input

Stress level: 8/10. Main stressors: Work deadlines, team conflicts, financial pressure, lack of personal time. Symptoms: Tight shoulders/neck, irritability, difficulty concentrating, racing thoughts at night. Current coping: Pushing through, occasional exercise, venting to partner. Effectiveness: Temporary relief but stress returns quickly. Goals: Feel more in control, better work-life boundaries, sleep without racing thoughts.

### Output

**Stress Reduction Plan**

**Stress Pattern Analysis:**

- Primary drivers: Work demands + lack of boundaries
- Stress response: Physical tension + mental hyperactivity
- Current coping gap: Reactive (after stress builds) vs. proactive (prevention)
- Key opportunity: Boundary setting and daily decompression

**Immediate Relief Techniques:**

_For Physical Tension (Shoulders/Neck):_

- 90-second shoulder drops: Raise shoulders to ears, hold 5 sec, release
- Neck rolls: Slow circles, 5 each direction
- Jaw release: Unclench jaw, massage masseter muscles

_For Racing Thoughts:_

- 4-7-8 breathing: Inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8 (3-4 cycles)
- Thought parking: Write worry on paper, set aside until designated time
- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: Name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste

_For Irritability:_

- STOP technique: Stop, Take breath, Observe feeling, Proceed mindfully
- 60-second pause before responding when triggered
- Physical reset: Brief walk, cold water on face, stretch

**Daily Stress Management Routine:**

_Morning (5 minutes):_

- 3 deep breaths before checking phone/email
- Set one boundary intention for the day
- Brief stretch or movement

_Workday Micro-Breaks (every 90 minutes):_

- Stand, stretch, 5 breaths
- Brief walk if possible
- Mental transition between tasks

_End-of-Work Transition (10 minutes):_

- Define "work done" point (don't keep checking)
- Physical ritual: Change clothes, shower, walk
- Mental separation: Write tomorrow's top 3 priorities, close laptop

_Evening (10 minutes):_

- Worry window: 10 minutes designated for processing concerns
- After worry window: Redirect to present activity
- Pre-bed: Breathing practice or body scan

**Boundary Strategies:**

_Work Boundaries:_

- Define and communicate availability hours
- "I'll get back to you by [time]" instead of immediate response
- Protect focus time blocks

_Energy Boundaries:_

- Identify energy drains, reduce where possible
- Schedule recovery after demanding interactions
- Say no to non-essential commitments (temporarily)

**Sleep Support:**

- Worry journal by bed: Write concerns, close book, leave for tomorrow
- No work discussions within 1 hour of sleep
- If racing thoughts: 4-7-8 breathing, body scan meditation

**Long-Term Resilience:**

- Increase exercise frequency (stress buffer)
- Weekly planning to reduce deadline surprises
- Monthly stress check-in: What's working, what needs adjustment

**Progress Indicators (4 weeks):**

- Stress level: 6/10 or below
- Physical tension: Reduced frequency
- Sleep: Fewer racing thought nights
- Boundaries: Feeling more in control
