## Example Usage

### Input

Work week: 45-50 hours, some evenings, occasional weekend emails. Schedule control: moderate, can adjust some meetings. Personal responsibilities: single parent to 8-year-old, aging parent care. Current disconnect: usually just close laptop but mind keeps racing. Few boundaries - work laptop in bedroom, phone always accessible. Daughter says I'm "always working." Current stress: 7-8/10.

### Output

**Current Balance Assessment**

| Dimension           | Grade | Issue                                             |
| ------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Physical boundaries | D+    | Work laptop in bedroom, phone always accessible   |
| Digital boundaries  | D     | Always reachable via phone, no auto-responders    |
| Temporal boundaries | D     | No clear start/stop times, work bleeds everywhere |
| Mental boundaries   | D     | Work thoughts intrude during family time          |

_Core Issue:_ Your daughter perceives you as "always working" despite your efforts. The problem isn't work quantity - it's boundary visibility and mental presence.

**Physical Separation Strategy (Implement This Week)**

_Home Zones:_

- Work laptop stays in living room/kitchen only - NEVER bedroom
- Bedroom becomes 100% work-free zone
- Phone charges outside bedroom overnight
- Create visual "work corner" with clear shutdown ritual

_Physical Signals:_

- Work: Laptop open, phone on desk
- Personal: Laptop closed and put away, phone in kitchen dock
- Daughter sees the difference and knows which mode you're in

**Digital Boundary System**

_Email Expectations:_

- Client/colleague email signature: "I respond within 24 hours, Monday-Friday"
- Auto-responder for evenings: "Currently with family, will respond tomorrow morning"

_Emergency Contact:_

- Separate phone number or specific contact for TRUE emergencies only
- Everyone else waits until morning

_App Management:_

- Work email OFF phone (or in separate focus mode profile)
- Slack notifications off after 6:30 PM

**Evening Shutdown Ceremony (6:30 PM)**

This ritual takes 5 minutes but signals to you AND your daughter that work is done:

1. **Close laptop** and say out loud "Work is finished for today"
2. **Write tomorrow's top 3 priorities** on notepad (gets tasks out of head)
3. **Put work phone in kitchen dock** (visible to daughter)
4. **Physical transition**: Change clothes OR wash hands (signals shift)
5. **Connection moment**: Ask daughter "What was the best part of your day?"

_Why this works:_ Your daughter SEEs you put work away. She hears you say it's done. The ritual is visible proof you're present.

**Evening Protection Blocks**

| Time          | Activity               | Rule                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 6:30-8:30 PM  | 100% daughter time     | No phone, no laptop, no exceptions  |
| 8:30-9:30 PM  | Personal decompression | Bath, reading, Netflix (guilt-free) |
| 9:30-10:00 PM | Tomorrow prep          | Clothes, meals, quick tidy          |

**Communication Scripts**

_For Clients:_
"To ensure I can give your project my best focus, I've found these communication windows work most effectively:

- Email responses: Within 24 hours, Monday-Friday
- Phone calls: Available Tuesday/Thursday 1-3 PM or by appointment
- Emergencies: Use [number] - please reserve for true urgencies"

_For Colleagues:_
"I'm fully focused during work hours but protect family time in evenings. For anything needed before tomorrow, please flag it by 5 PM."

_For Daughter:_
"From now on, when I'm with you after 6:30, work is completely done. My phone will be in the kitchen, and I'm 100% focused on our time together. Deal?"

**Weekend Architecture**

_Saturday:_

- Morning: Family adventure/activity (3 hours, phones away)
- Afternoon: Parallel time (daughter plays, you recharge nearby)
- Evening: Social or personal project time

_Sunday:_

- Morning: Household tasks with daughter help (teaching life skills together)
- Afternoon: Week prep (meal prep, schedule review)
- Evening: Family movie night or quiet time together

_Non-Negotiable:_ No work emails from Friday 6 PM to Monday 8 AM

**Guilt Management Strategies**

_Reframes for Common Guilt:_

| Guilt Thought                                | Reframe                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I'm not spending enough time with daughter" | "I'm modeling how to work hard AND be present when it matters" |
| "I'm not advancing my career fast enough"    | "I'm building sustainable success that supports my family"     |
| "I need personal time but feel selfish"      | "Taking care of myself makes me a better parent"               |
| "I should be available for work emergencies" | "Setting boundaries makes me more effective, not less"         |

_Quality Over Quantity Approach:_

High-impact activities even when time is limited:

- 20-minute bedtime routine with full attention
- Saturday morning adventures (phones away)
- Cooking one meal together weekly
- Car conversations during errands (captive quality time)

**Implementation Timeline**

_Week 1: Emergency Boundaries_

- Monday: Move work laptop out of bedroom
- Tuesday: Set up phone charging station in kitchen
- Wednesday: Draft and send client communication
- Thursday: Practice evening shutdown ritual
- Friday: Send boundary email to colleagues
- Weekend: First Saturday morning family adventure

_Week 2: Routine Establishment_

- Consistent 6:30 PM work shutdown daily
- Auto-responder set for evenings
- Daughter notices and comments on changes

_Month 1: Habit Formation_

- Shutdown ritual becomes automatic
- Protected Saturday morning time consistent
- Client expectations successfully reset
- Daughter says you're "here more"

**Success Metrics (Monthly Review)**

| Question                                               | Target                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Am I consistently protecting 6:30-8:30 PM family time? | Yes, 5+ nights/week       |
| How often did work stress spill into parenting?        | Decreasing trend          |
| What did daughter say about our time together?         | Positive feedback         |
| Personal energy maintained for both work and family?   | Sustainable, not depleted |

_Remember:_ Perfect balance doesn't exist, especially as a single parent. The goal is sustainable integration where you're fully present in whichever role you're in.
