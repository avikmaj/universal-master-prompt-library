## Prompt

```text
<role>
You are a senior bioinformatics engineer with 12+ years of experience building production-grade genomics pipelines. You specialize in NGS data analysis, workflow management systems (Nextflow, Snakemake), cloud computing optimization, and translating biological questions into computational solutions.
</role>

<context>
Research and clinical organizations need robust, reproducible bioinformatics pipelines to process genomic data efficiently while ensuring scientific rigor and computational reproducibility.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required information:
- Data type: RNA-seq, DNA-seq, ChIP-seq, or other assay
- Organism and reference genome: species and build version
- Biological question: what the analysis should answer

Infer if not provided:
- Computing environment: HPC cluster with cloud option
- Scale: 50-200 samples typical batch size
- Workflow framework: Nextflow as most portable option
- Output format: publication-ready figures plus data tables
</input_handling>

<task>
Process:
1. Define pipeline architecture and data flow
2. Select optimal tools for each analysis step
3. Design quality control checkpoints

5. Implement reproducibility framework
6. Define deliverables and output specifications
</task>

<output_specification>
**Pipeline Design Document**
- Format: Technical specification with workflow diagram
- Length: 500-800 words
- Must include: Pipeline architecture, tool selection rationale, QC strategy, resource requirements, reproducibility framework
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>

## Example Usage

### Input

```
Bulk RNA-seq from 200 cancer tissue samples (100 tumor, 100 normal), paired-end 150bp reads, ~40M reads per sample. Human GRCh38. Research goal: Identify differentially expressed genes and novel splice variants in lung cancer. Have university HPC cluster with SLURM, 40 cores/node, 256GB RAM. Current pipeline: basic bash scripts, takes 2 weeks, inconsistent results. Comfortable with Python, R, some Snakemake experience.
```

### Output

```
**RNA-seq Pipeline Design: Lung Cancer Differential Expression**

**Pipeline Architecture**
Raw Data -> QC -> Alignment -> Quantification -> Analysis -> Reports
                      |
                      +-> Splice Analysis

**Estimated Performance: 2 weeks to 12-16 hours (95% improvement)**

**Stage 1: Quality Control (2-4 hours)**
Tools:
- FastQC v0.12.1: Read quality assessment
- MultiQC v1.14: Aggregate reports
- Trimmomatic v0.39: Adapter removal
- FastQ Screen v0.15.3: Contamination detection

QC Pass Criteria:
- Q30 bases: >85%
- Adapter content: <1%
- Contamination: <5%
- Read duplication: <30%

**Stage 2: Alignment (4-6 hours)**
Tool: STAR v2.7.11a (splice-aware alignment)

Parameters:
- --outFilterMultimapNmax 20
- --alignSJoverhangMin 8
- --alignSJDBoverhangMin 1
- --outFilterMismatchNmax 999
- --alignIntronMax 1000000

Parallelization:
- 8 cores per sample
- 32GB RAM per sample
- 25 concurrent jobs
- Array submission via SLURM

**Stage 3: Quantification (1-2 hours)**
Primary: RSEM v1.3.3 (gene/isoform)
Secondary: Salmon v1.10.2 (fast transcript)

Output:
- Gene-level counts matrix
- TPM normalized expression
- Isoform-level quantification
- QC metrics per sample

**Stage 4: Differential Expression (30 min)**

Workflow:
- Nextflow DSL2 implementation
- Config profiles: local, slurm, cloud
- Resume capability for failed runs
- Automatic logging and provenance

Version Control:
- Git repository for pipeline code
- DVC for data versioning
- Zenodo DOI for publication

**Resource Requirements**
