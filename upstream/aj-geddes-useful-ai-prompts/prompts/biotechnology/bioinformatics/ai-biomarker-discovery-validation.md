## Example Usage

### Input

```
Developing prognostic biomarker for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to predict recurrence risk and guide adjuvant therapy decisions. Available: RNA-seq from 500 resected tumors (60% recurrence), clinical outcomes (5-year follow-up), matched normal tissue. Goal: identify patients who benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy vs. observation. Want to develop commercial diagnostic test. Need to outperform current TNM staging.
```

### Output

```
**NSCLC Recurrence Biomarker Program**

**Clinical Context**
- Unmet need: 40-50% of resected Stage I-II patients recur
- Current standard: TNM staging (limited predictive value)
- Target product: RNA-based multigene signature for treatment decisions

**Performance Targets**
Metric                 Target      Benchmark (TNM)
AUC                    >0.80       0.65
Sensitivity            >75%        60%
Specificity            >70%        55%
Hazard Ratio (high/low) >3.0       1.8
Clinical Utility       NRI >0.15   -

**Phase 1: Discovery (Months 1-8)**

*Data Preparation*
Cohort Split:
- Discovery: 350 samples (70%)
- Internal Validation: 150 samples (30%)
- External Validation: Seek public cohorts (TCGA, GEO)

Quality Filters:
- RNA quality: RIN >7
- Tumor purity: >60% (ESTIMATE)
- Follow-up: >3 years minimum
- Complete clinical annotation

**Phase 3: Clinical Validation (Months 17-24)**

*Prospective Study Design*
Study Type: Prospective-retrospective (archived samples)
Population: Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC, surgically resected
Sample Size: 400 patients (powered for hazard ratio)
Primary Endpoint: 3-year recurrence-free survival
Secondary: Treatment interaction (chemo benefit by risk)

Statistical Analysis:
