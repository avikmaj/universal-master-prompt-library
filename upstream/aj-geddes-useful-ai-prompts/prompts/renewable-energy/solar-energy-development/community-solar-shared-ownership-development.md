## Example Usage

### Input

We're developing a community solar program in Colorado for Xcel Energy territory. Target is 5 MW initial capacity serving Denver metro communities with high renter populations and above-average energy burdens. We have potential partnership with local community development organization and want to achieve 50% LMI participation.

### Output

**Community Solar Program Development: Denver Metro Initiative**

**Market Assessment**

The Denver metro area presents strong opportunity for community solar given Colorado's favorable regulatory environment and significant unmet demand. Analysis indicates:

- Target demographics: 45% renter population in focus neighborhoods with limited rooftop access
- Energy burden: Low-income households spending 8-12% of income on energy vs. 3% metro average
- Market size: Estimated 15,000 households meeting eligibility criteria in initial service area
- Competitive landscape: Active community solar market with remaining capacity in Xcel territory

**Program Design**

_Participation Models:_

- Standard subscription: 50-120% of annual usage, minimum 1 kW allocation
- LMI tier: Reduced subscription minimums, flexible payment terms, no credit check enrollment
- Community anchor: Schools, nonprofits, small businesses providing subscription stability

_Pricing Structure:_

- Guaranteed 15% bill credit discount vs. Xcel residential rates
- LMI enhanced discount: 20% through grant-funded rate reduction
- No upfront costs, month-to-month flexibility for LMI participants
